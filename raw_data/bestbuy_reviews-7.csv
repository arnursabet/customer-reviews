Amazing for the price!,"These earbuds are really good for just about $100, punchy and deep bass is really good and aound quality is very rich. Some fine tuning in the app definitely can make a difference. Call quality is also excellent and people can hear me clearly. The easy switching between noise canceling and pass through is a breeze and can make hearing others while listening to music a simple push of a button.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A
Sony’s Bang for the Buck!,"If you are a millennial, you might remember the Brand Sony for their stereos and walkmans. These cheap Bluetooth active noise cancelling TWS earphones remind me of that simple era.

They are compatible with an iphone but their true potential of auto connection is explored by an Android device.

They fit my large ears perfectly for that Noise cancelling seal. Smaller ear people might need to change the buds to a different size provided.

Noise cancelling is as good as the expensive ones. They do dull out the back ground hum of an airplane. Do not expect the performance of the fruit brand. Keep in mind the price you are paying and the value you are getting at this price point.

Impressive earbuds,"Excellent earbuds. Purchased this recently as my phone no longer supported my wired earbuds, and was instantly converted to the side of wireless earbuds. They fit my earholes perfectly and stay in during workouts, the sound is good with a nice option to use noise cancelling or let ambient noise in, and the batter life is great.

"GREAT SOUND, PRICE, AND COMFORTABLE","These sound really good out of the box but the app makes them way better. They also really comfortable i feel like i could sleep with them. The noise cancelling is pretty good too.

Decent wireless ear buds,"This is a DECENT pair of headphones ear buds considering the price. They work well indoors when on the phone, outside not so great. The noise canceling feature is fickle.

Great budget earbuds.,"These are great for a budget the active noise canceling is good enough. 
The pros is if you have a Sony Xperia phone the seamless integration is really cool. On the side sense you can see the Sony WF-7OON, on the information displaying like sitting and moving with adjusting the equalizer. These are very light earbuds compared to Sony flagship models that were very heavy and felt like they would fall off my ears. The active noise canceling does not provide good aware mode so often I cannot hear my colleagues talking to me or when I am driving my car I cannot hear the flow of traffic, I need some good earbuds that offer a way to adapt to local surroundings.
What are the cons on these earbuds are the battery case life capacity is 12 hours. Not very long in the earbuds world. I was surprised to see that the case has depleted it reserves after me using these earbuds for 2 days in a work environment of about 4 hours per day.",2,3,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A

Solid buds at a great price,"These Sony buds are fantastic and offer a lot of bang for the buck.  I replaced my daily drivers of 2 years with these and can tell you they don't feel budget to me at all.  

Box contains the pillbox looking charging case, buds and a USB C cable.  As I already have the Sony music app, pairing was a breeze.  I do recommend downloading the app so you can take full advantage of what the buds can offer.  I absolutely love Equalizer and not only can use the presets it comes with, but also my own preference but adjusting lows, mids and highs manually. 

Sound quality is excellent.  I have no complaints while watching movies, playing mobile games or listening to my library from metal to classical.  
Comfort is surprisingly great as well.  I am using the medium tips that were preinstalled and they fit nice and snug.  No discomfort from a 8 hour desk job and also at the gym while running on the treadmill.  
With that being said, battery life just keeps going.  1 gripe is that when you charge the case, it'll turn from red to green in real time, but the app won't update the % until you replace the buds and take them out again.  I used them in a 9 hour shift and they lasted all day, only having to charge it during my 1 hour lunch break.

Noise cancellation works well and so does the pass through.  Quite shocked for a pair of buds that are considered budget.  While on, I would clap or snap my fingers close to my ears and would barely hear it at all.

If you are looking at ear buds in the $100 price range and want the best, here they are.  Sony did an absolute rock solid job on these and I would definitely recommend them in a heartbeat.",3,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
Listen Up! Feature Packed Sony Wireless Earbuds!,"The feature rich Sony WF-C700N Wireless Earbuds (truly wireless, noise canceling, Bluetooth) are a great companion for the active lifestyle.
Whether it’s outside, inside the gym or mowing the lawn, I enjoy workouts in several places throughout the week.  I always use earbuds for music to make the time go by faster while exercising (and protection from the lawn mower noise).  This time, I was fortunate enough to use Sony’s new WF-C700N wireless earbuds.  With just a Bluetooth connection and music streaming service on my smart phone to the Sony WF-C700N wireless ear buds, I am ready to go! 
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come in a very small plastic case that will easily fit in your front pocket.  It is a bit slippery trying to hold on to it while opening it.  Once the case is opened you can easily remove the earbuds which are magnetically held in place.  When it is time to put the earbuds back in the case the same magnets snap them correctly into place.  A few other positives things about the case is the IPX4 rating, meaning it is splash/sweat proof (not waterproof).  In total you get around 15 hours of playtime when using the case (7.5 hours) to recharge the earbuds within the case (7.5 hours).  It takes about 1.5 hours to completely charge.   Each earbud separately has its own charge that is used while listening (it is displayed in the Sony App).  An USB Type A to a USB Type C connection, charges up the case.  The cord is really short so charging has to be done close to the source of power.  If the shortness of the cord is a negative, the charging of the case for 10 mins is a positive, which will give you 1 hour of playtime.
The earbuds are comfortably ergonomically made with three sizes of removable buds to allow for your best fit (small, medium, large). The buttons on the earbuds are big and easy to press for all the different modes making a slight digital beep when turn on/off.  This was a nice convenient surprise which made navigating the track, phone calls, noise canceling and pausing really pleasant.  
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come equipped with Sony’s DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine).  This process upgrades the music from any source from good to better and replicates the music the way the artist intends.  You can actually get CD quality sound or really close to it.
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds can connect to the Sony App for a major experience of informative fun. Use your smart phone’s camera on the QR Code after opening the box.  The link will appear for you go to download Sony’s App in which you select the correct product you are intending to use.  The App will help take pictures of your left ear then the right ear.  Analysis of these pictures will help you get the best sound possible out of your earbuds according to your ears.  The Sony App has an activity log/merit badge, time used with earbuds, an EQ, Ambient Noise Control, Adaptive Sound Control (actually saves and remembers your settings while automatically applying them to where you are!), any firmware updates and access to 360 Reality Audio Setup!  
The best feature, in my opinion is the 360-degree reality audio experience.  The music sweeps around your head space with “24 adaptive object-based points in a soundstage” like an atmosphere.  This creates an amazing experience when hooked up to a streaming music service that supports 360 Reality Audio: Tidal, Amazon Music Unlimited, Artist Connection, Nugs.net, PeerTracks.  Now at the moment Spotify doesn’t have premium above 320kbps, but it still is enhanced with these WF-700N wireless earbuds (not using the 360 Reality Audio).  While Stereo sound is great, eventually in my opinion, it will be replaced by 360 Reality Audio with more companies in the not-so-distant future.  The sound, like a “live concert,” or just listening to the different points all around you is simply amazing!  It is the best way to enjoy music.  The highs are clear and precise while the mids are solid and strong.  The bass is thumping but very accurate (20Hz-20kHz frequency range for earbuds).  The Sony App will guide you through the steps to take for the streaming service and 360 Reality Audio Setup. (You will have to create at one account in the process.)  
Last but not least, the large mics are in the front of the earbuds that give you better clarity and realism with the Ambient Noise Control off even with the music on (also aids better hearing/speaking in phone calls!).  You can also have two paired devices, like a smart phone or laptop that you can switch between without having to reset the Bluetooth every time. 
I really thoroughly enjoyed the Sony WF-C700N truly wireless noise canceling in-ear Bluetooth earbuds.  The Active Noise Canceling worked really well as did the comfortable fit, Sony App and 360 Reality Audio.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
Solid performer at a good price,"The Sony WF-C700N earbuds with noise canceling deliver good performance for the price. I have them in sage color that is soft on the eyes and gives them a more modern look. 

Setup requires downloading the Sony earphones app. Instructions are easy to follow and Bluetooth connection was problem free. The app is easy to navigate. Lots of options to configure the sound with an equalizer and other digital sound processes, and to customize the buttons. I quickly felt comfortable navigating the app and customizing the earbuds to my liking.  

The case is rechargeable through a usb-c connection; no wireless charging is offered. You can monitor the charge on the app. It charges the  earbuds quickly. From my experience, I was able to do about five full charges of the earbuds when they were running very low. 

The earbuds sound really good for the price. I own some high-end earphones and they come close; the highs are clear and not too straining, the mids are not too present and the bass is solid. I also listen to podcasts and they reproduce the vocals quite well. The noise canceling feature works great and mutes the outside distraction effectively. I use them more at work and wear them most of my workdays. I play different kinds of music and podcasts at 60% volume between 5 to 6 hours at a time. The batteries handle that easily; I usually have about 25-30% of charge left after those marathon sessions. They’re light and sit well outside the ear canal and are comfortable to wear for long hours. Those are regular earbuds and not made for exercise. They sit tight in your ear but they will fall off if you keep moving your head abruptly. Overall, the sound performance is solid.

The only gripe I have is that they require registration and music streaming subscription to take advantage of the Sony 360 Reality Audio. Music streaming such as Amazon Music and Tidal are compatible with the 360 Reality Audio. My subscribed music streamer does not support it unfortunately and I’m not able to experience it for now.

To conclude, I will say that besides not being able to exploit the full capabilities of those earbuds, I’m impressed with their sound quality, battery and noise canceling performances. I would describe the Sony WF-C700N earbuds as mid level earphones at an accessible price that deliver close to high end performance.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
Solid Offering Below Sony's TOTL,"The Sony - WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling In-Ear Headphones are solid & affordable option for anyone shopping for ear buds that are markedly less expensive than Sony's top-of-the-line models.

Pairing and setup was easy across the three different mobile devices I use; a Galaxy S23+ - a Sony NW-ZX707 Walkman and an Xperia Pro-I.  The Sony headphone app is well designed and easy to use, making the process of setting up the WF-C700Ns very easy and intuitive to do.  One thing I noticed with these particular buds is that the firmware update process was much quicker to apply & complete vs. my other Sonys.  Hats off to Sony for improving that facet!

The sound quality is highly customizable with the Sony app and no matter if you use one of many EQ profiles or simply leave it entirely off - the these ear buds sound fantastic than the lower-tiered Sony offerings of just a few years back.

Everyone's hearing profile and preferences are different but I personally find the Sony 'Excited' preset to perform the best - no matter the genre of music listened to.

The app gives clearly understandable status of the battery levels for each individual 'bud', along with the charging case.

These noise cancelling in-ear headphones punch well above their pay grade.  Clean & clear treble, solid & articulate midrange and plenty of well executed base.  Certainly not the best noise cancelling performance I've experienced but definitely good and more than adequate.

I like the way these fit compared to ANY of the other Sony ear buds I own or have tried.  There are light weight, well balanced and they stay-put!

My only gripe is the communication lag between the mechanical button functions and the device being used.  But this is a small nit and considering the price point, it's acceptable.  Capacitive touch buttons would have been appreciated but I get why those special features are assigned to the higher-end products from Sony.

These are solid for what they list price for and will be even more attractive on-sale.

Pros:
Excellent sound quality
Good noise cancellation performance
Plenty of volume, clarity & bass punch
Very comfortable to wear and they do 'stay put'
Really like the Sony Headphone app that gives good status levels and ease of control
Excellent set of pre-set EQ settings to choose from and the ability to manual contour your own profile
Didn't experience any connection issues or drop in sound quality
Battery life appears to be per-spec

Cons:
Not a huge fan of the integrated, mechanical buttons - but they do work
No 'ear sensors' to automatically put your listening on pause
Despite these two cost saving configuration features, I didn't penalize the score
You get what you pay for...",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
Great sound for a fair price,"I have several wireless earbuds, including another pair of Sony brand ones. These WF-C700N earbuds, or as they call them, in-ear headphones, have great sound! For the price point I am impressed. 

Everything you need to get started with these is in or on the small box. For instructions on how to use these, scan the QR code included. The paperwork inside the little box is just legal and safety stuff. Download the Sony Headphones app to get more out of these earbuds. There is a flush but pressable button on each earbud, something I like because when these earbuds have several functions and you are supposed to touch them a certain way, I tend to not use those functions. I like to wear these for working out. I wear both earbuds for that, and I don’t press the buttons by accident when I might lay my head on the floor (yoga, etc.) or put my arm next to my ear by accident, I don’t mess up the sound or change anything, which is nice. I also like to wear these with just one earbud at a time. Right now as I’m writing, I have just the left one in, listening to some music. Some earbud sets don’t function well this way or at all, but these do. These earbuds are also water resistant, although I haven’t really tested that with anything other than a bit of sweat, and they seem fine in that regard.

Battery life is a non-issue for me, knowinging that these are supposed to have 15 hours of battery life. That’s plenty of time for me. A USB-A to USB-C cable is included for charging. The charging case feels nice in hand, it’s just short of 3” long and the circumference is 4.5” . It looks like a black capsule. I haven’t been able to find information on this, but I think the case and most of the plastic would be mostly recycled materials, as is the case with my other pair of Sony earbuds. There are three sizes of ear tips included. Those are easy to pop on and off to see which ones you like the most. Even though I have small ears, the medium ones fit me nicely. These also don’t fall out of my ears or hurt, which can be an issue for some. Sony makes great products, and these are no exception. Great sound and they are customizable to your preferences.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
Budget friendly and balanced features.,"Sony - WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling In-Ear Headphones - Black

Summary:
High quality sound in a budget friendly, light, convenient, and comfortable package.

Pros:
* Price-point.  The price is spot on for the features of these earbuds. I think these offer great value.
* High-quality sound.  Surprisingly crisp sound AND effective noise cancellation.
* Form factor is thoughtfully designed.  No protruding plastics. No weird imbalanced weight.
* Right sized charging case.  While not wirelessly charged, the case is the right size and charges the earbuds quickly.  I haven't owned them long enough to see how many charging cycles it can sustain without itself being charged.
* Comfortable.  Due to the size, these fit perfectly in the ears and don't tire out the canals (if that makes sense).
* The controls are responsive, but you cannot fall asleep with them because the buttons might be depressed (depending on how you sleep).

Cons:
* Can't answer calls via Siri voice commands or use Siri at all.
* Need two apps to configure the earbuds.  One for the earbud advanced configuration, and another for the Live 360 Audio sound configuration.

Use:
I've had these a few days and I can say that I love them.  The sound and comfort easily beat the leading competing fruit brand.  

I have had a few pairs of earbuds over the years.  After replacing the fruit branded ones twice due to constant malfunction, I decided it was time to replace them with another brand.  Sony has been a consistent brand for audio in our home (we own some portable speakers of theirs) and thought we'd try their earbuds out.  

I'd recommend these headphones because of their price point.  If you need more advanced features or richer bass, you might consider other units.",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
"Incredible range, superb bass response!","Sony hit is out of the park again with the WF-C700N Wireless Noise Canceling Ear Buds!

I've been a life-long fan of Sony products, and here they continue to deliver on that tradition. They have been known for their 'Mega Bass' for years, and these small ear buds deliver a huge punch for the size. Opening the eco-friendly packaging, no plastics, but recycled cardboard throughout, you get a minimalist design for these ear buds. A charging cord, instructions and a couple of different sized ear tips are all that are in the package. 

There is one multifunction button on each side and you do have to read the instructions and memorize the number of presses to control the ear buds. Initially, setting them up was a little bit of a challenge. Holding down the buttons looking for the bluetooth lights, I didn't get any, like you would when normally pairing bluetooth products. 

Instead, you need to download the Sony Headphones app, which makes pairing and controlling them so much easier. Once downloaded, you can pair the headphones fairly easily - I say this because it still took two attempts for them to be fully recognized. This is my reason for docking one star in the review, as the initial out of the box experience wasn't straightforward like other bluetooth products I've used/paired with - they weren't intuitive. 

HOWEVER - once paired, the experience gets exponentially better. You have complete control over how the ear buds sound. You are taken through a listening experience in the app, where you are given options of what you are listening to, to absolutely fine tune the listening experience. You don't just have a 3 stage equalizer (bass, mid, high), it's 5 stages, but guides you through, playing music, and offering deep preference options. I was really impressed with that. 

Pressing the buttons on the ear buds gives you control over the volume, track playing, play, pause, and also the active noise canceling. You can enhance the sounds around you, so that you can still be aware of your surroundings, or you can 'cancel' them out and become fully immersed in your music. And talking of that, the bass that these tiny ear buds puts out is stellar. Very impressed that something so small can produce this amount of bass. Very impressive. 

They also have the ability to adapt the noise canceling functionality on the go. So for example, if you are sitting at your desk, you can have the noise canceling active, but when you stand up and move around, it activates the heightened listening, so that you can still hear your music but be aware of your surroundings. Go back to your desk and they revert to full noise canceling again. Great feature you never knew you needed, but so valuable. 

And range while walking around, is so impressive! I have a 4000sqft house, my office is in the middle of the house. I was able to walk upstairs and downstairs without any loss of signal from my phone, where other headphones I use would have dropped signal. I was really impressed with the distance I could walk away from my phone, with solid connectivity at all times! 

Overall - apart from the pairing issue at the very beginning, and not knowing if they were powered on or not (no lights or indicators on the ear buds), they have been an incredible set of ear buds and will become my go-to set to use daily. 

And talking of that - you can pair to more than one product (up to two) with this. So you can have them connected to your computer AND your phone at the same time, and they will select between the two as you receive phone calls or as you work. 

I have no hesitation in recommending these ear buds. Great product!",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
Disappointed.,Stopped working within a month of purchase. Not recommended.,3,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
Affordable Sony Noise Canceling Earbud,"I've been looking for true wireless noise canceling headphones for a while now and haven't been able to find a pair with great sound, comfortable to wear, affordable and are packed with features.  The hope was the Sony WF-C700N Noise Canceling earbuds would be the answer…and they are!

Sony’s packaging is top-notch and well thought out to protects the product and it’s all recycled material. The first thing I noticed upon opening the box was the small size of the WF-C700N earbuds.  I’ve tried a number of other earphones and have found some to be too large for everyday use/running/biking.  These earbuds are very small in comparison.   

In the box: 
The earbuds, charging case, charging cable and S, M and L earpieces and paperwork/quick start guide.

Set Up & Performance:
In terms of a quick start guide, it's pretty straight forward.  The earphones essentially connected to my iPhone 13 Pro as soon as I took them out of the charging/carry case.  I already have the Sony Headphone App installed on my phone for a pair of over-the-ear Sony headphones.  Once connected through the app, there was a firmware update that needed to be run.  It took a few minutes and then the earphones were ready to use.

The buds came with a medium sized fitment attached and they seemed to fit pretty well, so I fired up some tunes to see what they’re all about.  After walking around a bit, I noticed the right earbud was somewhat loose and had to readjust it a couple of times.  They are meant to be inserted and twisted into a “locked” position within the ear.  Initially I wasn’t inserting the earphones firmly enough, so the fitment issue was a “user error”.

The sound quality is good, but was lacking that rich bass sound expected from Sony.  At this point I used the Sony app to see what adjustments could be made to the sound quality.  The app is feature-rich and has a bunch of sound adjustments in the form of pre-programmed equalizer settings.  With a couple adjustments, I was able to correct the sound and add a little extra bass.  There are a number of setups  and controls to try…so most users will get the sound setup they are after.  The app also provides settings for the ambient sound/noise cancelling features, auto power off, changing button function on the earbuds, etc.

Phone calls sounded crisp and clear, these earphones have definitely become my go to solution when on the go for the phone feature alone.  

Next, I ran a quick 3 miles to see if they would hold in place and sound the same outside. The sound quality was great outdoors and the ambient settings are great allowing the user to select how much of the outside world comes through.  The connection was solid from both my iPhone and my Apple Watch. Now I can run with just my watch and these headphones and still stay in touch with the outside world...if wanted!  

Pros:
 - great quality Sony construction, fit and functionality
 - Noise Cancelling / Ambient settings
 - Easy to setup and use right out of the box with or without the Sony Headphones app
 - Included portable charging case for additional battery life and carrying on the go
 - Phone calls are easy to manage and excellent sound quality
 - Strong Bluetooth - Never lost connection, even when going in other rooms in my house 
 - One of the smallest truly wireless headphones out there
 - Great value

Cons: 
 - Earbuds did move around in my ear a bit, seemed to not want to “lock” into place that easily 

I would highly recommend these truly wireless headphones if you're looking for great sounding, comfortable headphones that have plenty of features and support phone calls. The addition of noise cancelling is an added bonus!",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2

Solid buds at a great price,"These Sony buds are fantastic and offer a lot of bang for the buck.  I replaced my daily drivers of 2 years with these and can tell you they don't feel budget to me at all.  

Box contains the pillbox looking charging case, buds and a USB C cable.  As I already have the Sony music app, pairing was a breeze.  I do recommend downloading the app so you can take full advantage of what the buds can offer.  I absolutely love Equalizer and not only can use the presets it comes with, but also my own preference but adjusting lows, mids and highs manually. 

Sound quality is excellent.  I have no complaints while watching movies, playing mobile games or listening to my library from metal to classical.  
Comfort is surprisingly great as well.  I am using the medium tips that were preinstalled and they fit nice and snug.  No discomfort from a 8 hour desk job and also at the gym while running on the treadmill.  
With that being said, battery life just keeps going.  1 gripe is that when you charge the case, it'll turn from red to green in real time, but the app won't update the % until you replace the buds and take them out again.  I used them in a 9 hour shift and they lasted all day, only having to charge it during my 1 hour lunch break.

Noise cancellation works well and so does the pass through.  Quite shocked for a pair of buds that are considered budget.  While on, I would clap or snap my fingers close to my ears and would barely hear it at all.

If you are looking at ear buds in the $100 price range and want the best, here they are.  Sony did an absolute rock solid job on these and I would definitely recommend them in a heartbeat.",3,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Listen Up! Feature Packed Sony Wireless Earbuds!,"The feature rich Sony WF-C700N Wireless Earbuds (truly wireless, noise canceling, Bluetooth) are a great companion for the active lifestyle.
Whether it’s outside, inside the gym or mowing the lawn, I enjoy workouts in several places throughout the week.  I always use earbuds for music to make the time go by faster while exercising (and protection from the lawn mower noise).  This time, I was fortunate enough to use Sony’s new WF-C700N wireless earbuds.  With just a Bluetooth connection and music streaming service on my smart phone to the Sony WF-C700N wireless ear buds, I am ready to go! 
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come in a very small plastic case that will easily fit in your front pocket.  It is a bit slippery trying to hold on to it while opening it.  Once the case is opened you can easily remove the earbuds which are magnetically held in place.  When it is time to put the earbuds back in the case the same magnets snap them correctly into place.  A few other positives things about the case is the IPX4 rating, meaning it is splash/sweat proof (not waterproof).  In total you get around 15 hours of playtime when using the case (7.5 hours) to recharge the earbuds within the case (7.5 hours).  It takes about 1.5 hours to completely charge.   Each earbud separately has its own charge that is used while listening (it is displayed in the Sony App).  An USB Type A to a USB Type C connection, charges up the case.  The cord is really short so charging has to be done close to the source of power.  If the shortness of the cord is a negative, the charging of the case for 10 mins is a positive, which will give you 1 hour of playtime.
The earbuds are comfortably ergonomically made with three sizes of removable buds to allow for your best fit (small, medium, large). The buttons on the earbuds are big and easy to press for all the different modes making a slight digital beep when turn on/off.  This was a nice convenient surprise which made navigating the track, phone calls, noise canceling and pausing really pleasant.  
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come equipped with Sony’s DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine).  This process upgrades the music from any source from good to better and replicates the music the way the artist intends.  You can actually get CD quality sound or really close to it.
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds can connect to the Sony App for a major experience of informative fun. Use your smart phone’s camera on the QR Code after opening the box.  The link will appear for you go to download Sony’s App in which you select the correct product you are intending to use.  The App will help take pictures of your left ear then the right ear.  Analysis of these pictures will help you get the best sound possible out of your earbuds according to your ears.  The Sony App has an activity log/merit badge, time used with earbuds, an EQ, Ambient Noise Control, Adaptive Sound Control (actually saves and remembers your settings while automatically applying them to where you are!), any firmware updates and access to 360 Reality Audio Setup!  
The best feature, in my opinion is the 360-degree reality audio experience.  The music sweeps around your head space with “24 adaptive object-based points in a soundstage” like an atmosphere.  This creates an amazing experience when hooked up to a streaming music service that supports 360 Reality Audio: Tidal, Amazon Music Unlimited, Artist Connection, Nugs.net, PeerTracks.  Now at the moment Spotify doesn’t have premium above 320kbps, but it still is enhanced with these WF-700N wireless earbuds (not using the 360 Reality Audio).  While Stereo sound is great, eventually in my opinion, it will be replaced by 360 Reality Audio with more companies in the not-so-distant future.  The sound, like a “live concert,” or just listening to the different points all around you is simply amazing!  It is the best way to enjoy music.  The highs are clear and precise while the mids are solid and strong.  The bass is thumping but very accurate (20Hz-20kHz frequency range for earbuds).  The Sony App will guide you through the steps to take for the streaming service and 360 Reality Audio Setup. (You will have to create at one account in the process.)  
Last but not least, the large mics are in the front of the earbuds that give you better clarity and realism with the Ambient Noise Control off even with the music on (also aids better hearing/speaking in phone calls!).  You can also have two paired devices, like a smart phone or laptop that you can switch between without having to reset the Bluetooth every time. 
I really thoroughly enjoyed the Sony WF-C700N truly wireless noise canceling in-ear Bluetooth earbuds.  The Active Noise Canceling worked really well as did the comfortable fit, Sony App and 360 Reality Audio.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Solid performer at a good price,"The Sony WF-C700N earbuds with noise canceling deliver good performance for the price. I have them in sage color that is soft on the eyes and gives them a more modern look. 

Setup requires downloading the Sony earphones app. Instructions are easy to follow and Bluetooth connection was problem free. The app is easy to navigate. Lots of options to configure the sound with an equalizer and other digital sound processes, and to customize the buttons. I quickly felt comfortable navigating the app and customizing the earbuds to my liking.  

The case is rechargeable through a usb-c connection; no wireless charging is offered. You can monitor the charge on the app. It charges the  earbuds quickly. From my experience, I was able to do about five full charges of the earbuds when they were running very low. 

The earbuds sound really good for the price. I own some high-end earphones and they come close; the highs are clear and not too straining, the mids are not too present and the bass is solid. I also listen to podcasts and they reproduce the vocals quite well. The noise canceling feature works great and mutes the outside distraction effectively. I use them more at work and wear them most of my workdays. I play different kinds of music and podcasts at 60% volume between 5 to 6 hours at a time. The batteries handle that easily; I usually have about 25-30% of charge left after those marathon sessions. They’re light and sit well outside the ear canal and are comfortable to wear for long hours. Those are regular earbuds and not made for exercise. They sit tight in your ear but they will fall off if you keep moving your head abruptly. Overall, the sound performance is solid.

The only gripe I have is that they require registration and music streaming subscription to take advantage of the Sony 360 Reality Audio. Music streaming such as Amazon Music and Tidal are compatible with the 360 Reality Audio. My subscribed music streamer does not support it unfortunately and I’m not able to experience it for now.

To conclude, I will say that besides not being able to exploit the full capabilities of those earbuds, I’m impressed with their sound quality, battery and noise canceling performances. I would describe the Sony WF-C700N earbuds as mid level earphones at an accessible price that deliver close to high end performance.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Solid Offering Below Sony's TOTL,"The Sony - WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling In-Ear Headphones are solid & affordable option for anyone shopping for ear buds that are markedly less expensive than Sony's top-of-the-line models.

Pairing and setup was easy across the three different mobile devices I use; a Galaxy S23+ - a Sony NW-ZX707 Walkman and an Xperia Pro-I.  The Sony headphone app is well designed and easy to use, making the process of setting up the WF-C700Ns very easy and intuitive to do.  One thing I noticed with these particular buds is that the firmware update process was much quicker to apply & complete vs. my other Sonys.  Hats off to Sony for improving that facet!

The sound quality is highly customizable with the Sony app and no matter if you use one of many EQ profiles or simply leave it entirely off - the these ear buds sound fantastic than the lower-tiered Sony offerings of just a few years back.

Everyone's hearing profile and preferences are different but I personally find the Sony 'Excited' preset to perform the best - no matter the genre of music listened to.

The app gives clearly understandable status of the battery levels for each individual 'bud', along with the charging case.

These noise cancelling in-ear headphones punch well above their pay grade.  Clean & clear treble, solid & articulate midrange and plenty of well executed base.  Certainly not the best noise cancelling performance I've experienced but definitely good and more than adequate.

I like the way these fit compared to ANY of the other Sony ear buds I own or have tried.  There are light weight, well balanced and they stay-put!

My only gripe is the communication lag between the mechanical button functions and the device being used.  But this is a small nit and considering the price point, it's acceptable.  Capacitive touch buttons would have been appreciated but I get why those special features are assigned to the higher-end products from Sony.

These are solid for what they list price for and will be even more attractive on-sale.

Pros:
Excellent sound quality
Good noise cancellation performance
Plenty of volume, clarity & bass punch
Very comfortable to wear and they do 'stay put'
Really like the Sony Headphone app that gives good status levels and ease of control
Excellent set of pre-set EQ settings to choose from and the ability to manual contour your own profile
Didn't experience any connection issues or drop in sound quality
Battery life appears to be per-spec

Cons:
Not a huge fan of the integrated, mechanical buttons - but they do work
No 'ear sensors' to automatically put your listening on pause
Despite these two cost saving configuration features, I didn't penalize the score
You get what you pay for...",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Great sound for a fair price,"I have several wireless earbuds, including another pair of Sony brand ones. These WF-C700N earbuds, or as they call them, in-ear headphones, have great sound! For the price point I am impressed. 

Everything you need to get started with these is in or on the small box. For instructions on how to use these, scan the QR code included. The paperwork inside the little box is just legal and safety stuff. Download the Sony Headphones app to get more out of these earbuds. There is a flush but pressable button on each earbud, something I like because when these earbuds have several functions and you are supposed to touch them a certain way, I tend to not use those functions. I like to wear these for working out. I wear both earbuds for that, and I don’t press the buttons by accident when I might lay my head on the floor (yoga, etc.) or put my arm next to my ear by accident, I don’t mess up the sound or change anything, which is nice. I also like to wear these with just one earbud at a time. Right now as I’m writing, I have just the left one in, listening to some music. Some earbud sets don’t function well this way or at all, but these do. These earbuds are also water resistant, although I haven’t really tested that with anything other than a bit of sweat, and they seem fine in that regard.

Battery life is a non-issue for me, knowinging that these are supposed to have 15 hours of battery life. That’s plenty of time for me. A USB-A to USB-C cable is included for charging. The charging case feels nice in hand, it’s just short of 3” long and the circumference is 4.5” . It looks like a black capsule. I haven’t been able to find information on this, but I think the case and most of the plastic would be mostly recycled materials, as is the case with my other pair of Sony earbuds. There are three sizes of ear tips included. Those are easy to pop on and off to see which ones you like the most. Even though I have small ears, the medium ones fit me nicely. These also don’t fall out of my ears or hurt, which can be an issue for some. Sony makes great products, and these are no exception. Great sound and they are customizable to your preferences.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Budget friendly and balanced features.,"Sony - WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling In-Ear Headphones - Black

Summary:
High quality sound in a budget friendly, light, convenient, and comfortable package.

Pros:
* Price-point.  The price is spot on for the features of these earbuds. I think these offer great value.
* High-quality sound.  Surprisingly crisp sound AND effective noise cancellation.
* Form factor is thoughtfully designed.  No protruding plastics. No weird imbalanced weight.
* Right sized charging case.  While not wirelessly charged, the case is the right size and charges the earbuds quickly.  I haven't owned them long enough to see how many charging cycles it can sustain without itself being charged.
* Comfortable.  Due to the size, these fit perfectly in the ears and don't tire out the canals (if that makes sense).
* The controls are responsive, but you cannot fall asleep with them because the buttons might be depressed (depending on how you sleep).

Cons:
* Can't answer calls via Siri voice commands or use Siri at all.
* Need two apps to configure the earbuds.  One for the earbud advanced configuration, and another for the Live 360 Audio sound configuration.

Use:
I've had these a few days and I can say that I love them.  The sound and comfort easily beat the leading competing fruit brand.  

I have had a few pairs of earbuds over the years.  After replacing the fruit branded ones twice due to constant malfunction, I decided it was time to replace them with another brand.  Sony has been a consistent brand for audio in our home (we own some portable speakers of theirs) and thought we'd try their earbuds out.  

I'd recommend these headphones because of their price point.  If you need more advanced features or richer bass, you might consider other units.",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
"Incredible range, superb bass response!","Sony hit is out of the park again with the WF-C700N Wireless Noise Canceling Ear Buds!

I've been a life-long fan of Sony products, and here they continue to deliver on that tradition. They have been known for their 'Mega Bass' for years, and these small ear buds deliver a huge punch for the size. Opening the eco-friendly packaging, no plastics, but recycled cardboard throughout, you get a minimalist design for these ear buds. A charging cord, instructions and a couple of different sized ear tips are all that are in the package. 

There is one multifunction button on each side and you do have to read the instructions and memorize the number of presses to control the ear buds. Initially, setting them up was a little bit of a challenge. Holding down the buttons looking for the bluetooth lights, I didn't get any, like you would when normally pairing bluetooth products. 

Instead, you need to download the Sony Headphones app, which makes pairing and controlling them so much easier. Once downloaded, you can pair the headphones fairly easily - I say this because it still took two attempts for them to be fully recognized. This is my reason for docking one star in the review, as the initial out of the box experience wasn't straightforward like other bluetooth products I've used/paired with - they weren't intuitive. 

HOWEVER - once paired, the experience gets exponentially better. You have complete control over how the ear buds sound. You are taken through a listening experience in the app, where you are given options of what you are listening to, to absolutely fine tune the listening experience. You don't just have a 3 stage equalizer (bass, mid, high), it's 5 stages, but guides you through, playing music, and offering deep preference options. I was really impressed with that. 

Pressing the buttons on the ear buds gives you control over the volume, track playing, play, pause, and also the active noise canceling. You can enhance the sounds around you, so that you can still be aware of your surroundings, or you can 'cancel' them out and become fully immersed in your music. And talking of that, the bass that these tiny ear buds puts out is stellar. Very impressed that something so small can produce this amount of bass. Very impressive. 

They also have the ability to adapt the noise canceling functionality on the go. So for example, if you are sitting at your desk, you can have the noise canceling active, but when you stand up and move around, it activates the heightened listening, so that you can still hear your music but be aware of your surroundings. Go back to your desk and they revert to full noise canceling again. Great feature you never knew you needed, but so valuable. 

And range while walking around, is so impressive! I have a 4000sqft house, my office is in the middle of the house. I was able to walk upstairs and downstairs without any loss of signal from my phone, where other headphones I use would have dropped signal. I was really impressed with the distance I could walk away from my phone, with solid connectivity at all times! 

Overall - apart from the pairing issue at the very beginning, and not knowing if they were powered on or not (no lights or indicators on the ear buds), they have been an incredible set of ear buds and will become my go-to set to use daily. 

And talking of that - you can pair to more than one product (up to two) with this. So you can have them connected to your computer AND your phone at the same time, and they will select between the two as you receive phone calls or as you work. 

I have no hesitation in recommending these ear buds. Great product!",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A

Affordable Sony Noise Canceling Earbud,"I've been looking for true wireless noise canceling headphones for a while now and haven't been able to find a pair with great sound, comfortable to wear, affordable and are packed with features.  The hope was the Sony WF-C700N Noise Canceling earbuds would be the answer…and they are!

Sony’s packaging is top-notch and well thought out to protects the product and it’s all recycled material. The first thing I noticed upon opening the box was the small size of the WF-C700N earbuds.  I’ve tried a number of other earphones and have found some to be too large for everyday use/running/biking.  These earbuds are very small in comparison.   

In the box: 
The earbuds, charging case, charging cable and S, M and L earpieces and paperwork/quick start guide.

Set Up & Performance:
In terms of a quick start guide, it's pretty straight forward.  The earphones essentially connected to my iPhone 13 Pro as soon as I took them out of the charging/carry case.  I already have the Sony Headphone App installed on my phone for a pair of over-the-ear Sony headphones.  Once connected through the app, there was a firmware update that needed to be run.  It took a few minutes and then the earphones were ready to use.

The buds came with a medium sized fitment attached and they seemed to fit pretty well, so I fired up some tunes to see what they’re all about.  After walking around a bit, I noticed the right earbud was somewhat loose and had to readjust it a couple of times.  They are meant to be inserted and twisted into a “locked” position within the ear.  Initially I wasn’t inserting the earphones firmly enough, so the fitment issue was a “user error”.

The sound quality is good, but was lacking that rich bass sound expected from Sony.  At this point I used the Sony app to see what adjustments could be made to the sound quality.  The app is feature-rich and has a bunch of sound adjustments in the form of pre-programmed equalizer settings.  With a couple adjustments, I was able to correct the sound and add a little extra bass.  There are a number of setups  and controls to try…so most users will get the sound setup they are after.  The app also provides settings for the ambient sound/noise cancelling features, auto power off, changing button function on the earbuds, etc.

Phone calls sounded crisp and clear, these earphones have definitely become my go to solution when on the go for the phone feature alone.  

Next, I ran a quick 3 miles to see if they would hold in place and sound the same outside. The sound quality was great outdoors and the ambient settings are great allowing the user to select how much of the outside world comes through.  The connection was solid from both my iPhone and my Apple Watch. Now I can run with just my watch and these headphones and still stay in touch with the outside world...if wanted!  

Pros:
 - great quality Sony construction, fit and functionality
 - Noise Cancelling / Ambient settings
 - Easy to setup and use right out of the box with or without the Sony Headphones app
 - Included portable charging case for additional battery life and carrying on the go
 - Phone calls are easy to manage and excellent sound quality
 - Strong Bluetooth - Never lost connection, even when going in other rooms in my house 
 - One of the smallest truly wireless headphones out there
 - Great value

Cons: 
 - Earbuds did move around in my ear a bit, seemed to not want to “lock” into place that easily 

I would highly recommend these truly wireless headphones if you're looking for great sounding, comfortable headphones that have plenty of features and support phone calls. The addition of noise cancelling is an added bonus!",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A

Solid buds at a great price,"These Sony buds are fantastic and offer a lot of bang for the buck.  I replaced my daily drivers of 2 years with these and can tell you they don't feel budget to me at all.  

Box contains the pillbox looking charging case, buds and a USB C cable.  As I already have the Sony music app, pairing was a breeze.  I do recommend downloading the app so you can take full advantage of what the buds can offer.  I absolutely love Equalizer and not only can use the presets it comes with, but also my own preference but adjusting lows, mids and highs manually. 

Sound quality is excellent.  I have no complaints while watching movies, playing mobile games or listening to my library from metal to classical.  
Comfort is surprisingly great as well.  I am using the medium tips that were preinstalled and they fit nice and snug.  No discomfort from a 8 hour desk job and also at the gym while running on the treadmill.  
With that being said, battery life just keeps going.  1 gripe is that when you charge the case, it'll turn from red to green in real time, but the app won't update the % until you replace the buds and take them out again.  I used them in a 9 hour shift and they lasted all day, only having to charge it during my 1 hour lunch break.

Noise cancellation works well and so does the pass through.  Quite shocked for a pair of buds that are considered budget.  While on, I would clap or snap my fingers close to my ears and would barely hear it at all.

If you are looking at ear buds in the $100 price range and want the best, here they are.  Sony did an absolute rock solid job on these and I would definitely recommend them in a heartbeat.",3,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Listen Up! Feature Packed Sony Wireless Earbuds!,"The feature rich Sony WF-C700N Wireless Earbuds (truly wireless, noise canceling, Bluetooth) are a great companion for the active lifestyle.
Whether it’s outside, inside the gym or mowing the lawn, I enjoy workouts in several places throughout the week.  I always use earbuds for music to make the time go by faster while exercising (and protection from the lawn mower noise).  This time, I was fortunate enough to use Sony’s new WF-C700N wireless earbuds.  With just a Bluetooth connection and music streaming service on my smart phone to the Sony WF-C700N wireless ear buds, I am ready to go! 
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come in a very small plastic case that will easily fit in your front pocket.  It is a bit slippery trying to hold on to it while opening it.  Once the case is opened you can easily remove the earbuds which are magnetically held in place.  When it is time to put the earbuds back in the case the same magnets snap them correctly into place.  A few other positives things about the case is the IPX4 rating, meaning it is splash/sweat proof (not waterproof).  In total you get around 15 hours of playtime when using the case (7.5 hours) to recharge the earbuds within the case (7.5 hours).  It takes about 1.5 hours to completely charge.   Each earbud separately has its own charge that is used while listening (it is displayed in the Sony App).  An USB Type A to a USB Type C connection, charges up the case.  The cord is really short so charging has to be done close to the source of power.  If the shortness of the cord is a negative, the charging of the case for 10 mins is a positive, which will give you 1 hour of playtime.
The earbuds are comfortably ergonomically made with three sizes of removable buds to allow for your best fit (small, medium, large). The buttons on the earbuds are big and easy to press for all the different modes making a slight digital beep when turn on/off.  This was a nice convenient surprise which made navigating the track, phone calls, noise canceling and pausing really pleasant.  
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come equipped with Sony’s DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine).  This process upgrades the music from any source from good to better and replicates the music the way the artist intends.  You can actually get CD quality sound or really close to it.
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds can connect to the Sony App for a major experience of informative fun. Use your smart phone’s camera on the QR Code after opening the box.  The link will appear for you go to download Sony’s App in which you select the correct product you are intending to use.  The App will help take pictures of your left ear then the right ear.  Analysis of these pictures will help you get the best sound possible out of your earbuds according to your ears.  The Sony App has an activity log/merit badge, time used with earbuds, an EQ, Ambient Noise Control, Adaptive Sound Control (actually saves and remembers your settings while automatically applying them to where you are!), any firmware updates and access to 360 Reality Audio Setup!  
The best feature, in my opinion is the 360-degree reality audio experience.  The music sweeps around your head space with “24 adaptive object-based points in a soundstage” like an atmosphere.  This creates an amazing experience when hooked up to a streaming music service that supports 360 Reality Audio: Tidal, Amazon Music Unlimited, Artist Connection, Nugs.net, PeerTracks.  Now at the moment Spotify doesn’t have premium above 320kbps, but it still is enhanced with these WF-700N wireless earbuds (not using the 360 Reality Audio).  While Stereo sound is great, eventually in my opinion, it will be replaced by 360 Reality Audio with more companies in the not-so-distant future.  The sound, like a “live concert,” or just listening to the different points all around you is simply amazing!  It is the best way to enjoy music.  The highs are clear and precise while the mids are solid and strong.  The bass is thumping but very accurate (20Hz-20kHz frequency range for earbuds).  The Sony App will guide you through the steps to take for the streaming service and 360 Reality Audio Setup. (You will have to create at one account in the process.)  
Last but not least, the large mics are in the front of the earbuds that give you better clarity and realism with the Ambient Noise Control off even with the music on (also aids better hearing/speaking in phone calls!).  You can also have two paired devices, like a smart phone or laptop that you can switch between without having to reset the Bluetooth every time. 
I really thoroughly enjoyed the Sony WF-C700N truly wireless noise canceling in-ear Bluetooth earbuds.  The Active Noise Canceling worked really well as did the comfortable fit, Sony App and 360 Reality Audio.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Solid performer at a good price,"The Sony WF-C700N earbuds with noise canceling deliver good performance for the price. I have them in sage color that is soft on the eyes and gives them a more modern look. 

Setup requires downloading the Sony earphones app. Instructions are easy to follow and Bluetooth connection was problem free. The app is easy to navigate. Lots of options to configure the sound with an equalizer and other digital sound processes, and to customize the buttons. I quickly felt comfortable navigating the app and customizing the earbuds to my liking.  

The case is rechargeable through a usb-c connection; no wireless charging is offered. You can monitor the charge on the app. It charges the  earbuds quickly. From my experience, I was able to do about five full charges of the earbuds when they were running very low. 

The earbuds sound really good for the price. I own some high-end earphones and they come close; the highs are clear and not too straining, the mids are not too present and the bass is solid. I also listen to podcasts and they reproduce the vocals quite well. The noise canceling feature works great and mutes the outside distraction effectively. I use them more at work and wear them most of my workdays. I play different kinds of music and podcasts at 60% volume between 5 to 6 hours at a time. The batteries handle that easily; I usually have about 25-30% of charge left after those marathon sessions. They’re light and sit well outside the ear canal and are comfortable to wear for long hours. Those are regular earbuds and not made for exercise. They sit tight in your ear but they will fall off if you keep moving your head abruptly. Overall, the sound performance is solid.

The only gripe I have is that they require registration and music streaming subscription to take advantage of the Sony 360 Reality Audio. Music streaming such as Amazon Music and Tidal are compatible with the 360 Reality Audio. My subscribed music streamer does not support it unfortunately and I’m not able to experience it for now.

To conclude, I will say that besides not being able to exploit the full capabilities of those earbuds, I’m impressed with their sound quality, battery and noise canceling performances. I would describe the Sony WF-C700N earbuds as mid level earphones at an accessible price that deliver close to high end performance.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Solid Offering Below Sony's TOTL,"The Sony - WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling In-Ear Headphones are solid & affordable option for anyone shopping for ear buds that are markedly less expensive than Sony's top-of-the-line models.

Pairing and setup was easy across the three different mobile devices I use; a Galaxy S23+ - a Sony NW-ZX707 Walkman and an Xperia Pro-I.  The Sony headphone app is well designed and easy to use, making the process of setting up the WF-C700Ns very easy and intuitive to do.  One thing I noticed with these particular buds is that the firmware update process was much quicker to apply & complete vs. my other Sonys.  Hats off to Sony for improving that facet!

The sound quality is highly customizable with the Sony app and no matter if you use one of many EQ profiles or simply leave it entirely off - the these ear buds sound fantastic than the lower-tiered Sony offerings of just a few years back.

Everyone's hearing profile and preferences are different but I personally find the Sony 'Excited' preset to perform the best - no matter the genre of music listened to.

The app gives clearly understandable status of the battery levels for each individual 'bud', along with the charging case.

These noise cancelling in-ear headphones punch well above their pay grade.  Clean & clear treble, solid & articulate midrange and plenty of well executed base.  Certainly not the best noise cancelling performance I've experienced but definitely good and more than adequate.

I like the way these fit compared to ANY of the other Sony ear buds I own or have tried.  There are light weight, well balanced and they stay-put!

My only gripe is the communication lag between the mechanical button functions and the device being used.  But this is a small nit and considering the price point, it's acceptable.  Capacitive touch buttons would have been appreciated but I get why those special features are assigned to the higher-end products from Sony.

These are solid for what they list price for and will be even more attractive on-sale.

Pros:
Excellent sound quality
Good noise cancellation performance
Plenty of volume, clarity & bass punch
Very comfortable to wear and they do 'stay put'
Really like the Sony Headphone app that gives good status levels and ease of control
Excellent set of pre-set EQ settings to choose from and the ability to manual contour your own profile
Didn't experience any connection issues or drop in sound quality
Battery life appears to be per-spec

Cons:
Not a huge fan of the integrated, mechanical buttons - but they do work
No 'ear sensors' to automatically put your listening on pause
Despite these two cost saving configuration features, I didn't penalize the score
You get what you pay for...",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Great sound for a fair price,"I have several wireless earbuds, including another pair of Sony brand ones. These WF-C700N earbuds, or as they call them, in-ear headphones, have great sound! For the price point I am impressed. 

Everything you need to get started with these is in or on the small box. For instructions on how to use these, scan the QR code included. The paperwork inside the little box is just legal and safety stuff. Download the Sony Headphones app to get more out of these earbuds. There is a flush but pressable button on each earbud, something I like because when these earbuds have several functions and you are supposed to touch them a certain way, I tend to not use those functions. I like to wear these for working out. I wear both earbuds for that, and I don’t press the buttons by accident when I might lay my head on the floor (yoga, etc.) or put my arm next to my ear by accident, I don’t mess up the sound or change anything, which is nice. I also like to wear these with just one earbud at a time. Right now as I’m writing, I have just the left one in, listening to some music. Some earbud sets don’t function well this way or at all, but these do. These earbuds are also water resistant, although I haven’t really tested that with anything other than a bit of sweat, and they seem fine in that regard.

Battery life is a non-issue for me, knowinging that these are supposed to have 15 hours of battery life. That’s plenty of time for me. A USB-A to USB-C cable is included for charging. The charging case feels nice in hand, it’s just short of 3” long and the circumference is 4.5” . It looks like a black capsule. I haven’t been able to find information on this, but I think the case and most of the plastic would be mostly recycled materials, as is the case with my other pair of Sony earbuds. There are three sizes of ear tips included. Those are easy to pop on and off to see which ones you like the most. Even though I have small ears, the medium ones fit me nicely. These also don’t fall out of my ears or hurt, which can be an issue for some. Sony makes great products, and these are no exception. Great sound and they are customizable to your preferences.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
Budget friendly and balanced features.,"Sony - WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling In-Ear Headphones - Black

Summary:
High quality sound in a budget friendly, light, convenient, and comfortable package.

Pros:
* Price-point.  The price is spot on for the features of these earbuds. I think these offer great value.
* High-quality sound.  Surprisingly crisp sound AND effective noise cancellation.
* Form factor is thoughtfully designed.  No protruding plastics. No weird imbalanced weight.
* Right sized charging case.  While not wirelessly charged, the case is the right size and charges the earbuds quickly.  I haven't owned them long enough to see how many charging cycles it can sustain without itself being charged.
* Comfortable.  Due to the size, these fit perfectly in the ears and don't tire out the canals (if that makes sense).
* The controls are responsive, but you cannot fall asleep with them because the buttons might be depressed (depending on how you sleep).

Cons:
* Can't answer calls via Siri voice commands or use Siri at all.
* Need two apps to configure the earbuds.  One for the earbud advanced configuration, and another for the Live 360 Audio sound configuration.

Use:
I've had these a few days and I can say that I love them.  The sound and comfort easily beat the leading competing fruit brand.  

I have had a few pairs of earbuds over the years.  After replacing the fruit branded ones twice due to constant malfunction, I decided it was time to replace them with another brand.  Sony has been a consistent brand for audio in our home (we own some portable speakers of theirs) and thought we'd try their earbuds out.  

I'd recommend these headphones because of their price point.  If you need more advanced features or richer bass, you might consider other units.",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
"Incredible range, superb bass response!","Sony hit is out of the park again with the WF-C700N Wireless Noise Canceling Ear Buds!

I've been a life-long fan of Sony products, and here they continue to deliver on that tradition. They have been known for their 'Mega Bass' for years, and these small ear buds deliver a huge punch for the size. Opening the eco-friendly packaging, no plastics, but recycled cardboard throughout, you get a minimalist design for these ear buds. A charging cord, instructions and a couple of different sized ear tips are all that are in the package. 

There is one multifunction button on each side and you do have to read the instructions and memorize the number of presses to control the ear buds. Initially, setting them up was a little bit of a challenge. Holding down the buttons looking for the bluetooth lights, I didn't get any, like you would when normally pairing bluetooth products. 

Instead, you need to download the Sony Headphones app, which makes pairing and controlling them so much easier. Once downloaded, you can pair the headphones fairly easily - I say this because it still took two attempts for them to be fully recognized. This is my reason for docking one star in the review, as the initial out of the box experience wasn't straightforward like other bluetooth products I've used/paired with - they weren't intuitive. 

HOWEVER - once paired, the experience gets exponentially better. You have complete control over how the ear buds sound. You are taken through a listening experience in the app, where you are given options of what you are listening to, to absolutely fine tune the listening experience. You don't just have a 3 stage equalizer (bass, mid, high), it's 5 stages, but guides you through, playing music, and offering deep preference options. I was really impressed with that. 

Pressing the buttons on the ear buds gives you control over the volume, track playing, play, pause, and also the active noise canceling. You can enhance the sounds around you, so that you can still be aware of your surroundings, or you can 'cancel' them out and become fully immersed in your music. And talking of that, the bass that these tiny ear buds puts out is stellar. Very impressed that something so small can produce this amount of bass. Very impressive. 

They also have the ability to adapt the noise canceling functionality on the go. So for example, if you are sitting at your desk, you can have the noise canceling active, but when you stand up and move around, it activates the heightened listening, so that you can still hear your music but be aware of your surroundings. Go back to your desk and they revert to full noise canceling again. Great feature you never knew you needed, but so valuable. 

And range while walking around, is so impressive! I have a 4000sqft house, my office is in the middle of the house. I was able to walk upstairs and downstairs without any loss of signal from my phone, where other headphones I use would have dropped signal. I was really impressed with the distance I could walk away from my phone, with solid connectivity at all times! 

Overall - apart from the pairing issue at the very beginning, and not knowing if they were powered on or not (no lights or indicators on the ear buds), they have been an incredible set of ear buds and will become my go-to set to use daily. 

And talking of that - you can pair to more than one product (up to two) with this. So you can have them connected to your computer AND your phone at the same time, and they will select between the two as you receive phone calls or as you work.

I already have the Sony Headphone App installed on my phone for a pair of over-the-ear Sony headphones.  Once connected through the app, there was a firmware update that needed to be run.  It took a few minutes and then the earphones were ready to use.

The buds came with a medium sized fitment attached and they seemed to fit pretty well, so I fired up some tunes to see what they’re all about.  After walking around a bit, I noticed the right earbud was somewhat loose and had to readjust it a couple of times.  They are meant to be inserted and twisted into a “locked” position within the ear.  Initially I wasn’t inserting the earphones firmly enough, so the fitment issue was a “user error”.

The sound quality is good, but was lacking that rich bass sound expected from Sony.  At this point I used the Sony app to see what adjustments could be made to the sound quality.  The app is feature-rich and has a bunch of sound adjustments in the form of pre-programmed equalizer settings.  With a couple adjustments, I was able to correct the sound and add a little extra bass.  There are a number of setups  and controls to try…so most users will get the sound setup they are after.  The app also provides settings for the ambient sound/noise cancelling features, auto power off, changing button function on the earbuds, etc.

Phone calls sounded crisp and clear, these earphones have definitely become my go to solution when on the go for the phone feature alone.  

Next, I ran a quick 3 miles to see if they would hold in place and sound the same outside. The sound quality was great outdoors and the ambient settings are great allowing the user to select how much of the outside world comes through.  The connection was solid from both my iPhone and my Apple Watch. Now I can run with just my watch and these headphones and still stay in touch with the outside world...if wanted!  

Pros:
 - great quality Sony construction, fit and functionality
 - Noise Cancelling / Ambient settings
 - Easy to setup and use right out of the box with or without the Sony Headphones app
 - Included portable charging case for additional battery life and carrying on the go
 - Phone calls are easy to manage and excellent sound quality
 - Strong Bluetooth - Never lost connection, even when going in other rooms in my house 
 - One of the smallest truly wireless headphones out there
 - Great value

Cons: 
 - Earbuds did move around in my ear a bit, seemed to not want to “lock” into place that easily 

I would highly recommend these truly wireless headphones if you're looking for great sounding, comfortable headphones that have plenty of features and support phone calls. The addition of noise cancelling is an added bonus!",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
