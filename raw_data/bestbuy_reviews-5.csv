A BEAST of headphones!?,"Hey everyone, it's me... AGAIN!, I’m here to share my thoughts on the Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones that I snagged from Best Buy. These aren’t just any headphones; these are the kind that promise to drown out the world around you with some fancy noise-cancelling tech.

**PURCHASE DETAILS**
I got lucky and caught these on a sale. I’m talking a sweet deal that didn’t make my wallet cry. Plus, being part of the Best Buy Total Tech gang has its perks - these cans came with AppleCare+ at no extra charge. Haven’t needed it for these headphones yet, but when I had a clumsy moment with my iPhone, AppleCare+ was a lifesaver, so it’s nice to have that safety net.

**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**
Out of the box, these headphones had that ‘new tech’ vibe that gets you all excited. They’re sleek, got that premium feel, and the Sandstone color is just classy. Picking them up, they felt solid but not like they’d be a weightlifting session for my neck. And those cushioned ear cups? They looked like they were going to be a treat for my ears. I couldn’t wait to put them to the test and see if they lived up to the hype.

**SETUP AND EASE OF USE**
Setting these up was a breeze. It was pretty much a case of 'turn on Bluetooth', 'select headphones', and bam! We were connected. No fiddling around, no 'why won’t you pair?!' moments. They synced up with my phone faster than I can make a cup of coffee. And switching from my phone to my laptop? Seamless. The controls are intuitive too; a few taps on the ear cup and I’m in control of my music, no need to fish out my phone.

**DESIGN AND COMFORT**
The design? It’s like they were made for my head. They’ve got this cool, understated look that doesn’t scream 'I’m trying too hard.' And comfort wise, it’s like snuggling your ears into your favorite pillow. I've worn them for hours, and there’s been no ear squishing or head clamping. They stay put, too, even when I’m headbanging to my favorite jams or shaking my head at another pointless meeting.

**PERFORMANCE**
Now, let’s talk about what you’re really here for – the noise cancellation and sound. The noise cancellation is the real deal. It’s like having your own personal mute button for the world. I’m talking ‘can’t hear the construction outside’ levels of quiet. And the sound? Crisp highs, balanced mids, and bass that’s just deep enough to feel in your chest without overpowering everything else. Battery life is solid too. I’ve gone days without a charge, and they’re still pumping out tunes like there’s no tomorrow.

**APPLECARE+ EXPERIENCE**
I haven’t had to use AppleCare+ for these headphones yet, which is a good thing, right? But knowing it's there is like having a safety net when you're walking a tightrope. I've had my dance with disaster before when my iPhone took a dive. AppleCare+ was a hero; got it fixed up without a fuss. It’s peace of mind, and with how I sometimes throw my stuff around, it’s not if I’ll need it, it’s when.

**PROS AND CONS**
Alright, so let's break it down. On the plus side, the sound quality is top-notch, and the noise cancellation is like a cone of silence; just magic. They're comfy enough to forget you're wearing them, and the battery life? It just goes on and on. But it's not all sunshine; the price tag can be a bit much if you don’t catch a sale like I did. And while the design is classy, it’s not exactly standout if you’re into that kind of thing.

**CONCLUSION**
Wrapping this up, I’d say these Beats Studio Pro headphones are a solid buy. They do what they say on the tin and then some. Whether you’re trying to focus in a noisy spot or just enjoy your tunes as the artist intended, these headphones have got you covered. They’re not just about the brand; they deliver.

**RATING**
I’d give them a strong 4.5 out of 5. Why not a full 5? Because perfect is a big word, and let's face it, the price can make you wince if you don’t snag that deal. But overall, these are some serious ear candy. Would recommend? Absolutely.",12,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A
They stay on & the sound is amazing blocks noise,"Perfect for the gym & for editing videos. I love the color so much they make every gym fit look cute! They block all outside noise, they don’t hurt my ears & they stay on while I workout. I do clean with a disinfectant wipe to clean sweat & bacteria off of them & they are perfect. Battery life is amazing & I am able to change music by calling Siri, might I mention I don’t have to be super loud at all for it to work & it’s hands free which is perfect for when I need to change the song in the middle of my set. Love them",11,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A
Great All around Headphones,"I love these headphones! It was either between the AirPod max or these and since they were on sale for a decent price, I decided to go with the Beats Studio pros in the color deep brown. The headphones are comfortable, the charge lasts a long time, and I’m able to use the same charger for my iPad Pro to charge these beats. It’s a win win. However, I feel like the sound on these headphones should be louder than what they are. I practically have to turn the volume to to almost 100% just so that I’m able to actually hear the bass in the songs I listen to. I know that Apple/Beats did this to protect people from harming their ears from loud sounds, but I don’t like the fact that I’m unable to change the volume from sounding too low even such a high volume. I’ve tried personalizing my Spatial Audio and it’s still sounds too low at 50% volume. In order for it to sound loud enough I have to keep the volume at around at least 90% volume. But other than that, they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and to do a decent workout in for long periods of time. They also sound excellent when I take phone calls. And I love how you can change the volume up and volume down, pause the music, and hang up phone calls without adding all those extra buttons to the headphones. Very minimalistic, sleek, and comfortable.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A
These are some exceptionally good headphones,"These headphones offer a commendable experience overall. The noise canceling effectively blocks out most surrounding noise, though the transparency mode is not quite on par with the AirPods Pro. However, the head tracking feature enhances the realism when combined with transparency mode.

The sound quality is decent, though not as premium as my Beats Studio 3. The bass is less pronounced, but the soundstage with Dolby Atmos is significantly wider, providing a more immersive listening experience.

The build quality leaves something to be desired. Folding and unfolding them feels a bit plastic and cheap, although the ear cuffs are an improvement over the Studio 3's. Despite this, they remain comfortable for extended use.

Overall, these are great headphones, and if you can get them at a discount, they are worth recommending.",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A
The Best Beats Ever,"Beats get better with every single release. These headphones are absolutely perfect for people who love music. When I put them on it’s like I am at a concert in the front row. The surround sound audio makes it feel like you’re inside of a studio. The noise cancellation is an amazing feature as well it makes me feel like i’m in my own world just me and my music. The audio quality gives the music so much more life. The transparency feature is also just as good, it works well when playing music as you can still hear your surroundings and your music with a perfect balance. the battery life is amazing as I have listened with them hours on end without fear of them dying. Whenever you want to escape from the outside world or just relax these Beats will do that for you to absolute perfection. These are the best headphones I have ever purchased and I use them everyday, mostly when studying and in the gym they provide me with 100% focus on my task with 0 distractions. The best product for students and athletes as well.",7,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A
My review on the Beats Studio Pro,"I got these beats around my birthday, and that was about a month ago. So I have been using them for quite some time, and they have been amazing headphones. Honestly the best headphones I have had, they go over the ear, they have noise canceling and also transparency mode as well as the normal mode. They last a very long time I have only charged them about 4 times max since I have gotten them. It also doesn’t take a long time to charge. The sound is amazing, it is so smooth doesn’t have any cracks or anything. You can also use them wired if you don’t can’t charge them, it comes with the wire adapter as well as the charger in the carrying case that fits the beats so well. They are so nicely packaged, and very easy to open and very quickly. I got the beats in the color deep brown. I instantly loved the color when I saw it. I knew that was the color I was gonna get, but when I seen the other colors I was getting indecisive because they have very nice colors for the beats it might not be many colors, but the colors they give us makes up for it. The colors they gave us are black, deep brown, navy, and sandstone. They are a neutral colors and they looks amazing. The beats themselves looks so beautiful and the colors just make them even better. They are perfect for exercising, cooking, watching a show, anything you can possibly think of, so if you are thinking about buying Beats Studio Pros I’d say go for it and don’t wait.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A

Beats Studio Pro Headphones,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Pro, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance. The sound quality is exceptional, delivering crisp highs and deep, rich bass. The noise isolation is remarkable, providing an immersive listening experience. Comfort is another standout feature; the ear cushions are plush, and the adjustable headband ensures a snug fit without causing discomfort during extended use. Additionally, the build quality is robust, and the wireless connectivity works seamlessly. The battery life is impressive, lasting for extended periods between charges.

Perfection,"Sound is amazing. Noise cancellation is impeccable. I use them for the gym and they work incredible. I always wipe them down after though with the cleaning solution and paper towels they have there and they still look brand new even though I’ve seeat all over them and had them for 2 mos and go to the gym 4x a week. Before i bought them i read a bunch of reviews saying you shouldnt use over ear headphones for the gym because they start to break down and peel on the earpieces because of the sweat. If you clean them and take care of them, they work amazing for the gym so it’s pretty simple, just dont be a moron. I will say the only “drawback” if it’s even a drawback is that the Sandstone color online looks pretty much white/cream but its actually grey/beige or like greige in real life. Not a fan of the color selection but otherwise incredible headphones. I got a steal on mine at $179 and do NOT regret the purchase. My airpods constantly fell out at the gym so these are a godsend. And they stay charged FOREVER. Ive charged these beasts ONCE since i bought them and like i said ive had them almost 2 mos.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A
Beats Studio Pro,"Bought these Beats Studio pro for $184 & with a price like that I couldn’t say no. Its noise cancellation feature is really good & is right up there with the Sony XM4’s. I’ve charged these headphones only once in the week that I bought them & they just last the battery life is no joke. The only downside or not depends how you look at it is that after 2 hrs of use you can really start feeling a bit uncomfortable to wear since they do clamp a little more compared to other headphones. However, if you use them in gym I would say it’s perfect.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A

Extraordinary sound quality,"I got my hands on the Beats Studio Pro headphones, and wow, I'm head over heels! The sound quality is just mind-blowing, seriously. And let me tell you, that noise cancellation? It's like stepping into a whole new world of music.

The design? It's sleek, it's stylish, and it feels like a dream on your ears. I could wear these all day without any discomfort.

A Beat & an Apple a day,"Initially, I really wanted the Apple Airpod Max headphones. When I walked in the local Best Buy store the associates were very helpful & knowledgeable. The Beats were chosen because they were on sale & more cost friendly. I have absolute become my best friend. The noise cancellation & sound are amazing when listening to music or movies on my phone. The quality is great & clear during phone calls. I love the creamy color I chose. They aren't heavy & quite comfortable to wear working out or traveling. The battery life is awesome! Happy Customer.

Best headphones EVER!,"These are undoubtedly the best headphones I've ever had, and I've had quite a few of them over the years with brands that include Bose, Sony, and Apple.

Great pair of headphones,These headphones look great in the sandstone color and on top of that they sound MUCH better than my AirPod pros. I get a much better listening experience with these. My only problem with these would be that they aren’t the most comfortable option out there since they are pretty tight and they tend to get uncomfortable after about an hour but I think for 180$ there is NO other pair of headphones that compete with these. If you’re thinking about purchasing a pair go ahead and buy them already they are a bang for your $.,1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A
Goldie locks found her sound :),"I really like these; this is my first set of headphone (since I was a teenager). I use my apple 2 pro earbuds a lot and love them but sometimes my ear gets a little irritated after all day and also no one can see then in my ears at work (girl long hair) so people have conversations with the back of my head :-/ These are much better on my ears and everyone can see them so they know to get my attention and that I’m not ignoring them. Besides these personal reasons I shipped online read many reviews and spoke to 2 BestBuy employees & cot lots of intel first. Budget wasn’t an issue I wanted something that sounded good, was comfortable, and had a long battery life. The apple ones were crazy heavy, the Sonys didn’t feel like the best fit or seem to noise cancel as good. These fit great, noise cancel really well, have a long battery, and sound crystal clear. I’ve been using them for some weeks now and would recommend them.

BEST BEATS EVER,"I cannot live without my Beat headphones! The sound quality is absolutely top-notch, with rich bass and crisp highs that make every song sound amazing. The battery life is impressive, lasting for hours on end without needing to be recharged. 
I love how these headphones have a fantastic connection, allowing me to roam up to 20 feet away from my device and still enjoy clear, uninterrupted music. The noise cancelling feature is also a game-changer, blocking out any unwanted distractions and allowing me to focus solely on my music.
What sets these headphones apart is the customization options - with different settings to tailor the sound to your preferences, you can truly make them your own. They are perfect for a good gym session, a run, or even hiking - they are durable, comfortable, and stay in place no matter what.

Great everyday headphones,They are good for the sale price. The battery life is great. I got these to use them at the gym because I hate the tracks they play at the gym.

The case to hold the beats is somewhat bulky, if you're someone that carries a small bag. But the case can fit a bunch of stuff WITH the headphones. Also, if you are switching the device you connect your headphones, too quickly, sometimes your headphones will kinda mess up.

The Best High End Headphones Money Can Buy!,"I purchased my Beats Studio Pro Headphones as my early birthday gift. At first I didn’t care for them but they really grew on me.

Great everyday headphones,They are good for the sale price. The battery life is great. I got these to use them at the gym because I hate the tracks they play at the gym. The noise canceling is great and button lay out is easy to remember. They do have a hot spot on your head. Need a little more cushion. Durability and battery life it definitely great. I which the bass was more punchy they are supposed to be known for the lows but I’m not feeling it. I have to play some track bass boosted to get it. All around great headphones for everyday activities.,1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6501025&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A

Favorite Headphones,"I purchased over the ear headphones, because my AirPods were irritating my ears. These are much more comfortable to wear. The color is beautiful and the noise cancellation is great. The controls sensitivity is very responsive and doesn’t lag. I only have to charge them once a week due to the battery life lasting much longer then 8 hours on the AirPod pros.

Beats Studio Pro purchased on sale,Excellent purchase at a great price. The option to turn off and  on noise canceling really helps when I'm in an area  that requires me to be aware of my surroundings. I wear glasses so I expected a little more discomfort but that's not the case. The battery charge holds for a long time as advertised. Surround sound when I'm watching late at night is more than decent. I can enjoy at a sound level above normal volume and not bother my family. This was an upgrade to Beats Studio 3 I purchased last year. Overall happy with both headphones but definitely enjoying pros more. Best Buy made this purchase seamless. Ordered online and picked up an hour later at my local store.

Workout and Outside Use,Headphones easily connect to phone and noise cancelation works wonders!

Beats,These headphones is loud you can hear the song or video playing while having them on or off long battery life went 2-3 days without charging them.

Best headphones I've owned.,"I've had my headphones for about 2 months now. I love them. The battery life is honestly longer than they advertise. I use my headphones practically everyday and I only charge them max twice a week. 

The case to hold the beats is somewhat bulky, if you're someone that carries a small bag. But the case can fit a bunch of stuff WITH the headphones. Also, if you are switching the device you connect your headphones, too quickly, sometimes your headphones will kinda mess up. 

I would recommend getting some silicone covers if you're someone who sweats/has oily skin.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6501025&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
