Sony's best earbuds to date,"I've enjoyed Sony's over-ear headphones for a while. I like their bass-heavy sound signature, it can be boomy while still clear. They have ANC that competes with other companies and is always in the top 5.

However, I've never liked their earbuds. The WF-1000XM3 never stayed in my ears and had terrible connectivity issues that made them completely unusable. The WF-1000XM4 stayed in my ears but hurt after a while and were too big. I stayed away from Sony and went through so many other companies. Each and every time I would conclude that ""these are my new earbuds!"" only to be disappointed a few weeks later with either ANC performance, fit, connectivity, bugs, or other issues that caused me to either exchange or return the earbuds.

I finally tried the WF-1000XM5, which I'm just going to call the XM5 from now on (Sony's naming scheme needs work). These are, without a doubt, the best true wireless earbuds I have listened to.

Sony cut down the size of the XM5 by quite a bit compared to the XM4 earbuds. Sony claims they're 25% smaller and I agree with that. There's no longer a large notch resting up against your outer ear and the rounded top fits within the pinna of the ear. These are so small, albeit still larger than the AirPods Pro 2, that I can comfortably sleep with them in.

Sony still relies on foam ear tips to achieve their sound and ANC. The ear tips are now a hybrid foam/rubber and more comfortable than the tips that came with the XM4. You don't need to squeeze the ear tips before inserting them in your ears. Just put them in and twist like normal earbuds. The XM5 still rely on the textured ear tips for staying in your ears, they aren't like the LinkBuds S where they use both the ear tips and earbuds to stay pinned in your ear. That's fine though, these haven't budged on me one bit after using them for multiple days for 6-8 hour each day.

Sony advertises 8 hours of battery life with ANC and the XM5 are able to reach that without issues. I've been able to hit the 8-hour mark and still have a 4-5% left in each earbud. The case provides 2 more charges allowing for 24 hours of use. A quick 2-minute charge will give you 1 hour of use.

ANC is top notch. I still they think fall behind the Bose QC Ultra earbuds and it's clear Sony is relying on the foam ear tips for more passive noise isolation to aid the ANC. But these are still great, better than the AirPods Pro 2, Jabra Elite 10, and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds. I can't much of anything when music or content is playing. Even sitting here now typing on a mechanical keyboard with music paused, the loud clicks of the keys are dull thuds. These have no issues on flights, blocking out the rumble of engines and HVAC systems, and various other sounds. Turn on music and the world is silenced.

Transparency mode is fine. It's not Bose or Apple-level, but it's still good enough. There's even a mode to amplify voices and block out other noises. One area Sony drastically improved is with microphones. Their processor effectively filters out background noise and isolates your voice for call. It might be more muted than the AirPods Pro 2, but they do a much better job of removing background noise. I've had no complaints taking phone calls next to busy roads, in the wind, and next to an external boiler for an HVAC system.

Controls are limited to simple touches that you can adjust. Single, double, triple, and quadruple taps along with a tap and hold can all do something. I left the default controls since it allows for volume control. Quadruple tap on the right earbud to increase volume, do the same on the left do decrease it. I much prefer having swipe controls for that, I have a feeling Sony will add those to the WF-1000XM6 next year.

The earbuds feature wear detection and will automatically pause and resume content when you remove one (or both) earbuds and put them back in. The case features for USB-C and Qi charging. Sony rates the earbuds as being IPX4 water-resistant. I haven't tested that outside of wearing these while profusely sweating from mowing the lawn. I'm not sure I would exercise with these, there are better earbuds for that with wing/fin tips. I also have a feeling that the foam ear tips would deteriorate after a while.

With all that said, how do they sound? Great. I didn't like the default sound profile. It's fine. Instead, I switched it to Excited in the app and bumped the Clear Bass up to +10 instead of +8. Yeah, some people would call that EQ an abomination, but I don't care. The bass is clear and boomy, mids still come across and aren't covered by the low, and the highs are details.

The sound stage is wide for earbuds. I think the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 are wider, but these are still good for closed-back earbuds. I don't have any complaints about the sound stage or instrument separation. Atmos music in Apple Music offers a nice listening experience. You don't get head tracking. I hate having to look straight forward for a balanced audio experience so I turned that off when I had the AirPods Pro 2 and Beats Fit Pro.

Overall, these are fantastic earbuds. I know some people are concerned with their battery longevity. The XM4 earbuds are known to be problematic. I haven't had any issues with these and I'm sure they'll be fine. Otherwise Sony's warranty will cover battery repairs by the time I'm ready to upgrade (the WF-1000XM6 are due about a year from now).

I highly recommend these if the XM3 and XM4 earbuds didn't fit your ears. They're smaller, sound quality is great, ANC is still top notch, and they're an overall improvement over older models. Connectivity has been great with no skipping or audible issues. You can't go wrong with these.",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
Very convenient with some good flexibility in use!,"I have used the Bose QC ultra and enjoyed them but lost them and decided to give these a try. The sound quality feels more clear with vocals and the multi point is the best feature I didn't know I needed. 

I can watch YouTube on my Samsung phone and simply pause the video/music and start playing something on my iPad and it switches seamlessly.

I am fairly new to wireless earbuds as I have mostly only used Sennheiser and beyerdynamic. These are so convenient to carry around and they have been very comfortable to me. I worry about them falling out more than the Bose but they have been pretty snug.

The battery life is incredible. I have fallen asleep with these and have woken up 8 hours later with them still charged (Nothing playing with ANC on). this is a big advantage over the Bose. I feel like the ANC is not as good but it's really hard to tell. They are quite similar enough to me that it doesn't matter.

Just a note on the apps between the two. The Bose app almost always fails to connect and requires re-pairing the buds or at least 20+ tries to get the app working to change settings or EQ but the Sony app works flawless and is always ready to go to make adjustments or EQ.

The only issue I have had with these is the touch controls. I wish I could remap them to whatever I want but you can only set them between a couple of predefined profiles(Bose is the same if I am remembering right).

Overall I am really enjoying the Sony XM5 buds",3,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
Good upgrade from the XM4s,"I had the WF-1000XM4s before the XM5s and I gotta say all the major flaws the XM4s had were solved with the XM5s. Notably, the smaller size of the buds make them more comfortable and reduce fatigue over a long period of time. I had major battery issues with the XM4s (that were apparently caused by a Sony software update, thanks Sony) but they seem to have overcome that issue. ANC has improved a bit but not much. Still love the sound from the Sony earphones over other brands I have tried, which is why I keep going back to them.

As for a flaw of the XM5s, the ambient noise mode has too much of an unnatural sound for me to use it comfortably. I'd rather just take the earbuds off to converse with somebody. Also the price, my wallet didn't appreciate that.

Side note, I bought a silicone case for them to prevent damage to the case as I've noticed they get scratched easily. Wireless charging works the same, highly recommend",5,2,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
40 out of 50,"I rate earbuds on 5 things, Noise Canceling, Sound, Voice Calling, Controls & Ear Fit.
Many professional reviews on these expensive earbuds or over-ear headsets are never helpful and accurate.  
Noise Canceling: Bose noise canceling is great (10), better than close comparison Sony - WF1000XM5 (9). Sennheiser Momentum closely matches up well with Bose (10).
Sound: Bose Sound is great, gives you a good spatial audio with bass and just has good depth (9.5), The Sony - WF1000XM5 sound is seriously not great, very mundane in my view, good treble (8). Sennheiser Momentum sound doesn’t have as much base to the Bose, but overall sound is better than the Bose (10).
Voice Calling: Most of this are ok with voice calling. I would say the Bose is a 9, Sony - WF1000XM5 is a 7 and Sennheiser Momentum 8.5
Controls: Bose controls are easier 10, Sony - WF1000XM5 packaging doesn’t even show the controls, have to research it (8) and Sennheiser Momentum 10.
Ear Fit (working out, not running): Bose fits well and stays (10). Sony - WF1000XM5 with the different tips do not stay in ear well (8). Sennheiser Momentum fits and stays well (10)",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
Amazing Fit and Sound. Better than LinkBuds S,"Disclaimer:
I want to preface this with a disclaimer: I have weird ears and am VERY picky on my earbuds. 90% of the earbuds I try DO NOT fit my ears. This includes previous Sony Earbuds, and other popular models like AirPods/AirPod Pros. I have bought and returned BOTH previous models of this earbud, the WF-1000MX3 & WF-1000MX4. But that all changed when these arrived! Finally, a pair of Sony WF Earbuds that I love! 

Fit & Sound:
The fit is amazing. I can wear these for hours without them bothering me. I love the earbud tips they come with, it’s an interesting hybrid of foam and rubber. But since they are kinda foam, you’ll want to make sure you are ‘rolling’ them on your fingers before insertion, as to smash the foam down. This allows them to expand in your ears for a proper fit. 
Also they sound amazing. The new bigger drivers are clearly at work here. ANC is a little better than the previous model I owned, LinkBuds S, but a little worse than the WH-1000MX5 (expected since those are full fat over-ear headphones. FIT IS ESSENTIAL HERE… POOR FIT = POOR ANC. Use all included ear tips and the Sony Headphones app which has a fit test. Some on Reddit also report good results with 3rd part EarTips but BE CAREFULL… these earbuds have no built-in mesh to stop your earwax from gumming them up, the mesh is on the EarTips… so make sure your 3rd part EarTips have mesh. Ambient sound mode is fine but has never blown me away. Can get a little windy which is annoying. I wish they would bring back the muffle wind option in the app.

Battery Life:
I have had great results on battery life so far. I think these could easily last a whole workday with ANC in their current state. But who knows how long that’ll last. Because of all the battery failures on the WF-1000MX4, I bought the Geek Squad protection just in-case.

Other Features:
Get the Sony Headphones app! They have a ton of cool features. I like the one where it tracks my weekly sound allowance and makes sure I’m not damaging my ears. You can also do stuff like spatial audio (doesn’t work on my new Samsung phone ugh) and enable stuff like nodding your head to accept/decline a call. Also you can manage sound quality settings, like using LDAC, and multipoint which allows you to connect to 2 devices at once (so awesome!). It also tracks the hours you put on the headphone if you sign into a Sony account, which I find very cool. Can’t wait to rack up 1000+ hours on these. 

VS LinkBuds S & Conclusion:
The LinkBuds S are another pair of Sony Earbuds that surprised me with how much I loved them. I think the MX5 sound better, due to their larger drivers. Also the ANC is a tad better on the MX5. Probably just mostly due to the better fit, but Sony would have you to think its all their new fancy chips in the MX5. I’m not sure. 
But here’s my conclusion: if you want 80% of the advantages of these earbuds and paying less than 80% of the price, I’d get the LinkBuds S on a sale for $120. But if you just want the best there is, get these. They fit and sound slightly better, with slightly better battery life. Get the Headphones app and keep and eye on the battery! May be worth it to get Geek Squad as well.",5,2,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
"The WF1000-xm5, Sony Sound Cancelling Earbuds","These have the best sound quality I have ever heard out of a pair of earbuds. The sound cancelling is amazing, the battery life is outstanding, and they don't falling out when you use the right earbud tip. They come with 4 and if I remember right medium is already on there and it goes all the way down to super small, and I was using those until I tried to clean them, the tips get very dirty as they are made out the same type of foam the ear plugs are made of, the will pull most of the earwax out of your ear. So cleaning them is a must, this however is very hard to do they are extremely easy to damage with finger nails, they fall apart in hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol, use warm water and a cotton q-tip. There are some cheap replacement options on amazon. 
Now on to the sound quality and range, The biggest thing is the sound cancelling on these is out of the world because of the tips are designed to seal your ear completely so it is insane good, The highs are amazing and mediums are amazing, and the lows are great. The lows are diffidently the spot they lack in. The sony headphone app will help a lot with that so I highly recommend using it. The battery life is probably like 8 hours per charge, I could spend a whole day using them and they would not disconnect or anything. Pairing them to a pc is easy as long as pc or laptop has bluetooth just open the case and hit the pair button the back. I use them a lot when I drive to answer calls or just to listen to music. The call quality is lacking and makes it go to transparency mode automatically.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
Another Home Run from Sony,"As good as the WF-1000XM4 earbuds are, I'm blown away by the new WF1000XM5's! I didn't think it was possible for the noise cancellation, sound quality and comfort to get any better then the previous generation Sony's, but man was I wrong! The battery life also seems to be much improved. I tried the top earbuds from most of the heavy hitters in this arena  (Bose, Apple, Samsung, Sennheiser) before snatching up these earbuds, and the Sonys came way out on top in everything that matters. Yet another home run from Sony!",3,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
One issue amongst many good things!,"After about a month the ambient noise setting stopped working for the left ear. I’ve tried troubleshooting it and restarting and even asking it politely to work, soo. that’s a thing that may happen beware. Also, I wish it came with smaller earbud tips because of my stupid tiny ear canals so I had to switch em out. OTHER THAN THAT these rock, the battery life is super long and charges really fast and it sounds good. and the connecting to two things at once is *chefs kiss*. also the app is really good too. i think worth the money, just gotta figure out this left earbud thingy i suppose",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A

Sound Issues at 299.99,"First off the design of the earbuds are amazing.  The fit and feel way better than the ""Sony WF-1000XM4.""

Sony also having their own app to help you customize your headphones/earbuds is quite a nice feature.

Secondly an improvement from it's predecessor is that you can use either earbud how you want.  With the ""WF-1000XM4"" the right earbud was the ""main"" so if you wanted to use the left, you had to have both.  The Sony Wireless WF-1000XM5 allows you to use whichever you please which is preferable.

The only issue I have is sound quality.  Sony has come a long way, so should their products.  Sometimes it sounds amazing, sometomes I to turn it all the way up just to hear it.  The most frustrating issue is their are time's where it sounds like certain parts of the track is muffled or underwater.  Some might try to say that ""oh your listening to a posted version from an unreliable source"" but I listen to it directly from the artist themselves.

Overall the earbuds aren't bad, Sony is heading in the right direction.  Just some small tune ups.",1,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
Great switch from AirPods.,"Talk about about a learning curve moving from AirPods to Sony but I'm kinda glad they did. The noise cancellation is much better allowing for the volume to not need to be so high. Also, speaking on the phone is slightly better. Battery life is also much better!!! With updates they are also working very similar to AirPods anyone when connected to iPhone. Slightly more secure in the ear too.",2,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
Incredible Headphones!,"I have used Bose and Sony noise canceling headphones in the past.

"Best-in-class, but improvements are possible","Last week, I traded in my old pair of WF1000XM4's for these, and much like the previous model, they are excellent noise cancelling earbuds with long battery life, and great portability. In the interest of full disclosure, I use non-standard memory foam eartips from Comply, which in my particular case improve comfort and noise isolation. Sound quality is crisp and clear, the touch controls are relatively intuitive, the earbuds themselves feel relatively light, and can sit comfortable in my ears for hours at a time. The multiple-device connection feature works pretty seamlessly too, and it's very convenient for any situation that may require you to switch back and forth between two audio sources. For anyone looking for a set of ultra-portable noise cancelling headphones, I can highly recommend these.

Despite my general satisfaction, I do have a few minor gripes about this new model. The glossy plastic finish on the earbuds looks excellent, but it makes them feel a little slippery. I can't help but think it's going to lead to them getting dropped a few times. I've also run into a few bugs when using these earbuds to control Audible playback, especially when connecting to multiple devices at once. I'm hesitant to blame Sony for that, as I've definitely found Audible to be one of the most temperamental apps I use regularly when it comes to playback control, regardless of the device controlling it. Finally, while these do feel more comfortable than the outgoing model, I find it a little harder to get them in and out of my ears than the previous model due to the rounded design and glossy plastic surface. Adjusting how I hold them has helped, but it just doesn't feel as natural as it did with my old pair. Perhaps that's habit more than anything, as I had that pair for almost 3 years. All of these are minor issues, none of which would lead me to choose a different product over these, but I felt compelled to mention them nevertheless.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A
The pickup is remarkable.,"The requirement for new earbuds arose due to the unfortunate misplacement of my Galaxy Buds 2 Pro by my children.

Though it is technically the next generation beyond the XM4's, it is nearly on par with my headset XM4 that I have used tirelessly. kind of sound compacted to this size is no short of incredible. The noise-cancelling is incredibly capable as well. I of course can't agree that it's the absolute best, but this can't be beat for this price. I only feel like there's much more room in terms of functionality with the touch controls, but most of the takeaways have been incredibly positive for me.

Glad I kept my WF1000XM4s,"Any enthusiasm I had for these is pretty much gone, and very happy I didn’t sell off my WF1000XM4s.  
They sound excellent, they pair up right well with the iPhone; beyond that, the little annoyances start to add up.  
First, the fit.  If you have larger ears, you’re going to experience a lot more outside noise than usual.  Some odd reason, the fit isn’t as tight as the previous model.  Switching to a larger tip makes it uncomfortable for me and then you have this issue where it doesn’t fit in the case perfectly.  Hopefully a third party like Comply or SpinFit will update their catalog to maybe remedy this. 
Two, random dropouts during playback.  Sometimes it’ll be the right bud, or both.  This may or may not be linked to the “unknown accessory” tab that randomly pops up on my phone screen.  This has never happened on the previous model or any of my other wireless ANC buds.  It’s quite annoying.  
New tips, maybe a firmware update will correct these annoyances ? 
I haven’t used these for phone calls.  As expected the battery life is excellent in both the buds, and case.  In the right setting, music detail , experience are excellent.",5,3,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A

Endgame earbuds,"A fantastic pair of earbuds that have blown every other pair I've tried out of the water. From the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro to the Technics AZ80, these buds outshine everything in terms of both sound quality and features. Sifting through the app (which sets up quick and easy) allows for one to toggle between ANC modes, set the modes to automatic, enable a Spotify quick play gesture directly on the earbuds, switch bluetooth codecs, toggle DSEE Extreme (lossy music upscaler), and calibrate head tracking amongst other things. The standout feature for a bass head like myself is Sony's Clear Bass technology, which allows for a crisp boost to the bass without a loss of volume or fidelity across the higher frequencies. My only gripe would be the battery life of the case, but as long as one charges regularly, this shouldn't be an issue.

Good...but,"These are everything the M4s aren't. They're small, they sound great, the ANC is top tier, the battery life is great. But they're not perfect. First off, I have huge comfort issues with the included foam eartips. They really start to hurt after about an hour or so. Second, the nozzle of the buds doesn't have any form of mesh or protection to stop earwax and moisture from entering the buds. This makes it increasingly difficult to buy silicone tips and when I did, the fit and ANC suffered greatly. Third, the ambient mode is average at best.

Good but not great!,"these are pretty good, but i ended up returning them and i will explain why:
I got both these and the Bose - QuietComfort Ultra, and as a BB total member, had some time to make the decision between the two. Went on 4 flights and compared overall performance between the two options, and the Sony fell a bit short on some key features for me:

1. Active Noise Cancellation: The Bose are way better in the ANC feature, especially in a flight, but even overall in a noisy environment, with high volume conversations in the background, The Sony were good, but in my opinion not even remotely close to the Bose.
2. Comfort in the ear: the Sony hve this foam like material that expands in the ear, which on the positive adds some more blocked noise cancellation, but on the negative after a while you start feeling in in your ear.
3. Sound wuality: I think the Bose are a better sound overall, both on phone calls and on music. Watched several TV shows and a Movie with both, and the sound coming from the Bose was more crisp and rich but the sound from the Sony was more bass and deep, so i guess it's a matter of individual preference.
4. App: having both apps, i can definitely say they both suck, but the Bose app sucks a bit less. I had some connectivity issues with the Sony on both my Samsung S24 Ultra and my Lenovo Laptop - maybe it was a local problem with the pair i had, but the BT kept disconnecting from the earbuds perspective once every couple of hours.

The only definitive advantage i found with the Sony earbuds was the microphone. the mic on the Sony is way better when having a phone call when compared to the Bose. the Bose have this echo resonance in the background but the Sony sounds good and clean. Verified with several calls to people and getting their feedback on how they heard the conversation from their perspective.

Overall, these are great, but for my individual needs the Bose were just a bit better (higher need for flights ANC).",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6546812&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2

Very good,"I’m a bit of an audiophile, so searching for the perfect earbuds was difficult. There are lots of options for higher-end earbuds. After watching and reading many reviews, I decided to get these. I had a pair of WF1000-XM3 for a few years and I had no complaints. I’m very happy with these WF1000-XM5 earbuds. The memory foam tips are really nice, and seal to your ear nicely without being uncomfortable. The earbuds are not bulky. The sound quality is nearly perfect for wireless earbuds. They have great, clean bass, smooth midrange, and crisp highs. The EQ is highly adjustable to tune to your liking. I would highly recommend these",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6546812&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2

Great earbuds,"Great earbuds. Prefer the fitment and noise cancellation over AirPod pros. However these are my second pair as the first pair was defective, it would cut off in one ear very randomly but the replacement hasn’t had any issues as of yet. Definitely recommend unless you get a bad pair..",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6546812&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
400 dollar giftcard please lol,"Definitely an Upgrade from the xm4s. Good sound, smaller case, totally worth the upgrade in my books.

Worth Purchasing,"As someone with small ears, I have tried numerous earbuds but every-time I would wear apple airpods or the linkbuds they would just come off immediately and I have tried getting smaller buds for it but wouldn’t stay in my ears for long. I came across these ones and tried them on literally right after I exited the store. I saw another review as they had a similar situation like me and I had high hopes. 
I only wore one earbud throughout the duration of the car ride and couldn’t hear my surroundings. I am really happy with my purchase as I also have the WH-1000XM4 headphones and I use them as my gaming headphones.
If you are thinking about buying new earbuds or a replacement, you should definitely invest in these ones.",1,2,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6546812&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
