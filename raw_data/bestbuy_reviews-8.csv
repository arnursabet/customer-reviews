Top Notch Earbuds,"These earbuds are one of my favorite. They have a great fit and sound. Overall a good improvement from the last generation. Most importantly, the transparency mode and ive ANC has been improved.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Rugged earbuds that stay in place with strong ANC,"Based on the performance, features, and functionality of the Jabra Elite 8 Gen2 wireless headphones, these are my new standard that all other wireless headphones will be compared against.  

In the box are the headphones, wireless charging case, 3 sizes of ear tips, and a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, with a 3.5mm aux crossover adaptor. While not required, you'll want to install the Jabra Sound+ app to maximize functionality and customization. To pair, push both earbuds for 3 seconds and select in your device's Bluetooth options. The headphones will connect to two devices, and uses Bluetooth 5.3 for stable connectivity. The earbuds will also connect to and stream from any Smartwatch that supports HFP, A2DP, or AVRCP Bluetooth profiles. One significant plus is that you can use the case for streaming when Bluetooth is unavailable or not preferred, assuming you have an 3.5mm port to plug into.  I've used this option with gym equipment, CD player, and a gaming desktop. I was impressed with the quality via case streaming, and found that these earbuds also do a great job with gaming sound. 

After setup, the app is where you'll want to go to customize settings, set pass through levels, control Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), adjust the 5 channel EQ or use one of the 6 preset options, configure tap control functions, and access resources such as firmware, warranty, and product help pages. See photos for reference. 

The first thing I noticed after unboxing was that the build felt both polished and durable.  The case has a single hinge that is approximately 50% the length of the case, allowing the lid to flip up and out of the way, but with enough friction to hold the lid open. The case has an LED indicator on it for pairing and charging visuals. The headphones themselves are small, and may take a bit to get used to if you have larger hands, the upside is that they magnetically lock into the case, so you don't risk dropping them or not getting them seated in the case to charge. I found that the sleek coating on the headphones make them a bit harder to grip getting out of the case, but the upside is that they fit snugly, securely, and comfortably into the ear. On the face of each earbud is a sensor for audio and call control. This is customizable, and is fairly standard with one, two, three tap as well as press and hold control options. The headphones offer all standard and expected functionality with call control, music control, ANC control, Spotify quick access, and voice assistant. 

As for software, the ANC is fantastic in comparison to other wireless earbuds, I can tell a significant difference going from HearThrough to ANC, even with no music playing, due to the wide frequency band of noise cancellation. The spatial sound is outstanding, and includes Dolby Audio. The big difference here is that the sound feels like it's coming from external speakers, not in your ear, for an immersive and natural listening experience.  The music audio quality is second to none when it comes to earbuds, the bass feels rich and not over driven, and during gaming I can hear footsteps and nuances I don't even hear as clearly in some of my gaming headphones. The microphone technology is fantastic and picks up my voice without any distortion or ambient noise during calls, even outdoors in windy to crowded environments. 

A few other points to note, the earbuds can be used individually or together, the case can be charged via the included USB cable or fast charged wirelessly, and the battery life is fantastic with multiple days of use in one charge. The ANC is great for blocking noise, especially doing outdoor chores such as mowing while still being able to quickly take calls without having to stop what I'm doing. Lastly the comfort is also stellar, I can wear these all day without having to reposition, they  stay in place during workouts as well as while walking or bike riding.  One other favorite feature is that they are easy to clean. I can take a wet cloth / cleaning wipe to them after workouts or using them outside during chores, dry them off, and put them in the case for next time, zero issues due to being waterproof. 

After a week of use, these are by far my new favorites based on the sound quality, ease of use, great ANC, and the fact that they stay in place, no matter how much I move.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Sturdy and long lasting,"I have had many Jabra wireless headphones throughout the years and my original pair that I have still work and I continue to use them to this day.  These Active 8 Gen 2’s are yet another step forward in Jabra’s wireless ear bud evolution.  These aren’t the best they make but they are sturdy and can take a beating.  They also sound great and one of the coolest features is the ability to use the case as a headphone connection to either a 3.5mm source or a USB-C source.   This comes in very handy when I just need a quick wireless connection w/o a BT connection.   I found that it works very well with no detectable latency.   Ear fitment with the medium tips fit me perfectly, but there are a small and large tip set also included.  The rubberized coating makes these easy to grip and I found that they stayed in my ears well during my run/walks on the treadmill.  I did have to adjust once in a while, but at no point did they fell like they were going to fall out.  They don’t have touch controls, but they have physical buttons that you have to push, I don’t mine this as it makes it easy to adjust them if needed w/o having to activate a touch sensitive button.   Multipoint connection is also a great feature, I have my laptop and my phone connected and I can easily switch between the connections as needed.   Using the Jabra Sound+ app is a must if you want to get the most out of these.  You can adjust the hear through, spatial sound, EQ settings, firmware upgrades, find my Jabra, and much more.  Battery life is rated at 8 hours and 3 extra charges with the case.  I have been using them as much as possible this past week and a half and the charge is 100% on the ear buds and the case is down to 70%.  One downside is that this case doesn’t provide wireless Qi charging.   The 6 microphones that these ear buds have really work well and call quality is great from what I am told, and the active Noise Cancellation reduces the outside noise by about 70-80% I would say.  These also have a 1-year warranty on defects or workmanship and a 2-year dust and water resistance warranty.   Overall, great sound, durability, long battery life, and the smart charging case make this a very good option and with my past experience with Jabra products, its one that I expect to last me a very long time.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Versatile with Great Noise Cancellation,"The Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 earphones, have been designed and built to withstand tough conditions, while still delivering decent quality sound, and as promised, they deliver. They are tough and suitable to be used outdoors, but of course you can also enjoy it indoors similarly to other high-quality earphones. You could be doing some intense activity or just relaxing, you may want complete noise cancellation or hear others while still listening to your tunes or answering a call, it doesn’t matter, these earphones adjust to your needs swiftly. So, there you have it, earphones that you can carry with you for almost any activity. With a long-lasting battery and the case ready to charge, you’ll have no problems going anywhere and not worry too much about running out of juice. I’d recommend the Jabra Elite 8 to anyone looking for a versatile, but still good quality sounding, pair of earphones.

>> Additional comments
I haven’t tested extensively under dust and water (sweat), but in my limited testing with wearing this doing exercise and some light rain, they performed well. So, I’d confirm they are suitable for sports and being active outside. The charging case looks durable, adding an additional layer of protection to the already tough earphones. The only complaint I have is that the earbuds would slide off somewhat easily when doing some intense activity (the motion plus the sweat I’d imagine, with the sweat being the main factor).
The carrying/charging case has an additional 3.5 mm input adapter (tied to an USB-C if you need USB-C), and you can use it to connect the case to a device that doesn’t have Bluetooth, then you can pair your earbuds to it. This looks very handy, and I am looking forward to my next trip and enjoy whatever entertainment the airlines provide me.
In terms of Software, the App available Jabra Sound+ App, and I installed the Android version. It is very intuitive, easy to configure and change the different settings. I installed the App on a Spanish locale Android phone, and the different explanations and descriptions look clear and spot on for the most part, the only thing I noticed so far is that HearThrough was left untranslated (well it doesn’t hinder the usability of the App). The App shows the battery levels for each earbud and for the case, and this might be one of the most useful aspects of the App as it lets me know whether to charge or not before leaving. All other settings, such as ANC are also reachable from within the App. There is also a Spotify playback option that I still need to configure and I look forward to using it.
To change the Sound mode, you can use the App as well as the earbuds. By pressing the side of the left earbud, you can “click” and cycle through the different modes. One interesting aspect is that you can choose to use Pink Noise to overcome complete silence. The one sound mode I love is the Active Noise Cancellation, which works great under noisy environments. The other mode I use frequently is the HearThrough one, comes in handy when talking to people directly and on the phone.
In terms of comfort, I’d say they are comfortable enough to wear that I could spend hours, even without listening to anything.
Power wise, this set outperforms others that I’ve own, between the long-lasting battery of the earbuds themselves, the case, with its rapid charge for busy/active people, provides enough power for a couple of days of use.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Major Improvements to an already Perfect Product!,"I currently use, well now used amd passed on to my wife, the Jabra Elite 8 Gen 1 ear buds, so, when Jabra said here comes Gen 2, I had to try them out.

First I have to note the best got better, and that is the boise canvelling  The Gen 1 set already had amazing noise cancelling but sometimes would take a few minutes to kick in, and if you mowed with your Gen 1 set  you would have noticed after a few minutes  the sound adjusted and noise cancelking became active. Now, with the Gen 2, they are instant, no waiting. I also noticed while weed whipping, the Gen 1s would allow a tad of the cutting of weeds sound come through once in a while, Gen 2 lets nothing through. The Noise Cancelling is so good on these Gen 2 earbuds, i can honestly say the immersion level of music and movie watchjng or even scrolling social media videos on dfferent platforms is so mucj better. 

Fitment is spot on as good as Gen 1, i feel there is zero difference there, just super comfortable amd can wear for hours on end with no needing of breaks from them. The physical push buttons are my favorite, some may not like they have to push buttons, myself, i love this, no unwanted touches like you get with other ear buds.

Next up is the Dolby support, these spund great with Dolby activated on my smart phone or laptop. Movies, games, music (especially live) and phone conversations sound amazing with Dolby on and do without as well. The Gen 2 Active 8s have a great even sound out if the box. Testing with no adjustments to the equalizer on my devices, they sound a tad clearer than Gen 1, highs are not tinny, mids are clear and unmuffled, and bass hits low but does not blow your ear drums doing so. With the adjustments in my eqalizers, I found you can really open these up to sounding much closer to studio headphones without the reference bass, instead the bass seems to cut off at about 43hz and tone down from there. 

I did try the Smart Case Spatial feature with my old tablet to see how it worked and I can confirm it works but not as well as the built in Dolby. I may be doing sowmthung wrong or not understanding it but to be honest, it is not what sold me on these, Jabra's quality and amazing customer service is what keepa me coming back to Jabra, period.

Great job Jabra, you have a customer for lofe with such great ear buds.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Pretty tough,"Jabra has stepped up here. These ear buds are pretty sweet. Out of the box they come with the charging case, the two earbuds, 3 sets of different sized ear gels, and a usb to usb-c cable. The ear gels that were already installed from the factory fit me great so I didnt try on the others. The case is nice and flat shaped to fit in your pocket better. Some competitors still arent doing this for some reason. These come with an impressive 2 year warranty. This was a great sign. 
The bluetooth connection is strong. I can walk around my 20x30 shop with my phone in the corner and have zero connection issues. I wore and used these over a 3 day period without a need for charging. I used them at the gym, during my runs, and at the office with fantastic results. The phone quality was great, people said it sounded like I was just on the phone in a quiet area, but I was outside most of the time. The adjustable noise canceling is a great option (in the app), I could choose how much outside noise I wanted to come through or not. Be sure to download the jabra app to get the full benefits of these buds. There is even a EQ to dial in the sound quality to your liking. 
I forgot to mention how easy the initial connection was, straight out of the case and they were in set up mode, no need to hold a specific button down or anything, super easy.
The audio sounds great with crisp highs and decent lows. These have spatial dolby audio, I was very happy with the music listening, podcasts, phone calls and even a movie.",1,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Excellent Heavy Duty Earbuds,"My last gym headset broke, and I needed a replacement. While I wouldn't say I don't like in-ear earbuds because I fear falling, I am very impressed with the new Jabra Tough earbuds. After a few days of heavy use, these are high-end quality with handy features, such as waterproof (not just water resistance) and military-grade durability. The earbuds feel very rugged and, at the same time, are very comfortable to wear even for prolonged use. The material's design and quality help them resist crushed or mishandled drops. The sound quality delivered is excellent. It features a balanced sound profile and decent customizable equalization (EQ). I frequently customize the mids and boost treble/bass using the app. The earbuds do an excellent job of rendering quality sound across a broad music spectrum. The noise cancellation is incredible; to relax or have quiet time in my house, I use these earbuds and listen to relaxing soundscapes, such as waterfalls, ocean, or rain The smart charging case includes a USB-C charging cable with an AUX adapter to connect the earbuds to any aux connection device, such as a Walkman or cassette tape. This AUX-to-case connection allows music into the buds from gym equipment, airplane monitors, etc. The earbuds are comfortable, stay in the ear, and enable me to wear them for hours without discomfort. Overall, I am delighted with these earbuds.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
"Great fit, case connection is so useful","Upgrading from previous generation Jabra, the upgrade in the case makes it worthy.

I like how these fit my ears and stay in place comfortably for hours.

Like other Jabra models, these have a very rich sound. Adjusting the sound profile via the app lets me find the right amount of bass and sound clarity.
Being an ‘active’ model, these are waterproof and great at resisting dust.

Jabra has been making headsets longer than anyone else and also one of the first earbuds. They've been refining this for many years and this model shows. Each earbud has several microphones and configurable side tone (almost of own voice heard back through the headphones), making it a more natural conversation, with adjustable wind noise control.
ANC and sound awareness (HearThrouh) are configurable through the app and can be activated by pressing the left earbud. They can also be used in 'mono' mode by wearing either one while the other is on the case.

The new feature on these ‘Gen 2’ models is the case: It’s very thin and can be charged wirelessly or via USB-C, and when connecting the USB-C cable to a computer or tablet, it works as an USB audio device (does not require Bluetooth), and not only that, the cable has a 3.5mm audio plug that can be used on a treadmill or airplane, which is why got these. When the case is connected this way, press the button on its side, it lights up white and then it works like wired headphones.

Note that USB audio is only for audio output only (not microphone), and volume control works like wired headsets.

Bluetooth connection is multipoint and remembers the last 10 connected devices. Multipoint allows connecting a laptop or watch and phone simultaneously for example. Fast/Switch pair supported on Android and Windows also. It supports SBC, AAC and LC3 codecs.

The controls are very intuitive. It has physical buttons, with configurable actions for single, double of triple click on either earbud. Holding the buttons increases or decreases the volume.
It can launch the phone’s voice assistant (Siri on iPhones) and can optionally launch Spotify with clicks.
It also has ear detection so can pause music when taking one of the earbuds off.

Battery is rated to last 8 hours with ANC and 14 without, before the earbuds need to be recharged. The case can charge the earbuds 4 times before it needs to be recharged.

Overall these are excellent, and the addition of the 3.5mm/USB-C audio in the case makes them so more useful.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Great for sweaty work outs and headphone jack use.,"Ear buds are just getting better and better...

Setup was really fast.  After initial charge of about 2 hours I went ahead and set this up on my 2 phones.  Both on android OS.  It took about 5 mins to do.  Great that these can pair with more than just 1 phone or device.  

The settings like noise cancelling and pass through was super easy to mess with and adjust in the software.  Button use.and voice commands was easy too.

Sound quality of music and phone were great.  I tested the Dolby Atmos spatial and it was decent...

In addition to 2 phone setup this can use the base as a transmitter to the ear buds....   this is great if you have an older headphone jack system with no Bluetooth like a CD player or hooking up to gym equipment etc....  Really versatile and convenient with these options to have this setup.

I have nothing but good sentiment about these ear buds.  Plus about 3 days worth of use with a fully charged holder and ear buds so far on a single charge.

Fit is great....  I worked out using these and even with full on swear.  They stayed out.  Did not fall out and did not get all clogged or drowned out the sound.

Nice color nice feel.  The feel has sort of a gripping type of surface..

I like these.  Been using these for over 1 week now.

Good job Jambra.

I would recommend these buds for the above.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
"Excellent sound quality, battery life, & durable!","When I heard I had the Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 coming my way, I was excited and saddened. Sad to hear that Jabra was leaving the consumer earbud space but excited because of what I had heard about the original Elite Active series! As soon as I opened the shipping box for these, I was impressed by how compact the packaging was. The last premium ANC earbuds I picked up were the Sony XM3s in 2019, five years of excellent audio quality and slowly reducing battery life ago, these are at LEAST half the size and weight! They feel premium, covered in a quality rubber that assures you it’s as tough as the box says it should be, the case is tiny compared to my old Sonys, so much more compact and convenient. Never fear, though, you can turn on “Find My Jabra” to trace your way back to where you might’ve left the case or earbud(s), I think this is just as thoughtful an inclusion as the tough build quality to ensure you can get your premium priced earbuds back if you lose them!

Setup is extremely easy, just download the app from scanning the QR code on top when you open the box and follow the instructions. This will suggest you follow a walkthrough of the features your new earbuds have and setup some of the behind-the-scenes items.

Features are plentiful! You can select what each number of taps does relating to a list of potential actions. The taps are of physical buttons on the earbuds, but they are soft enough to not put noticeable force into your ear like some require but also still works with gloves, sweat, and water on your fingers. In the app, you’re greeted with a handful of quick settings like selecting your listening mode (ANC, Hear Through, Off), EQ settings, and access to all of the other menus. You also can remove cards from the home screen, too.

Durability and battery life are amazing!!! The first day I got these, I took 5 minutes to quickly set them up to my Galaxy Z Flip 5, toss them in my ears, turn on hear through mode (with surrounds turned up to the max for safety), hopped on my bike and took off to my morning run club at the beach! This seemed like the perfect test of a “military grade” tough set of active earbuds… little bit of sand, lots of sweat, some water spillage, probable a drop, and maybe a quick swim. Well, I stopped after 5 minutes because the earbuds kept making a screeching noise and rebooting, I turned off the wind noise reduction mode and all was fine. It wasn’t quite working yet with the first batch of firmware, seems to be fixed now and Jabra customer support was friendly & helpful! They survived a sweaty 85F run, some beach volleyball, and I jumped in Lake Michigan for a quick swim. I know the Bluetooth isn’t going to stream through the water, but it feels great to jump in the lake immediately following a hot run or long bike ride and sometimes you just jump in without taking your gear off, earbuds included. They survived no problem and held a connection for longer than I thought! For battery, I only have to charge the case about once a week, maybe more if I bring them on a long distance bike ride, too, but if it’s runs, walks, in-office, listening at my desk, working at the bike stand, etc., once a week is more than enough to get you through! With the case using USB-C, you’ll have no problems finding a way to charge them if you need to and they can fast charge, too!

Overall, these things rock! The battery life is excellent, case is convenient and can double as a transmitter (hello Bluetooth on my old iPod!), the earbuds sound amazing with incredible noise cancellation, the hear through ambient mode is so clear that you might forget that you’re wear them, same with how lightweight they are! If you’re in the market for some of the best sounding and durable active earbuds, these are it. They’re expensive, but the features and quality are worth every dollar!",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Best earbuds - They stay in you ear!!,"These are by far the best earbuds I have tried. A couple of key points for those that might be looking at earbuds, these stay in your ears firmly. I’ve used them for jogging and weightlifting with little to no movement. The sound quality is amazing as is the active noise cancellation. I can use them while riding in my jeep with the doors off and roof down and people on the other side have no idea because of their ability to block wind noise. I love being able to use the Smart Case to plug into the plane’s 3.5mm jack and use it for Bluetooth connectivity. I’ve since stopped using anything else for video calls as well. I bought a pair for my wife as well and will probably get a couple pairs as Christmas gifts.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Great alternative to AirPod pros,"I was looking for a replacement for my iPod pros and after researching decided on these. I’ve been really pleased with them over the past few weeks. They are less noticeable than AirPods so I look normal on zoom calls, the actual button actions are nice, the noise cancelling is fantastic! I do struggle to get them connected every so often, but it’s infrequent so not terribly concerned with that. I also tried the cable they include that allows you to plug the case into a normal headphone jack while traveling and listen on the earbuds and it was seamless- very handy for work travel. Battery life is PHENOMENAL. They’re very functional and comfortable, I’m happy with my purchase.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A

Well designed and engineered headset.,"These are phenomenal earbuds, but didn’t ultimately fit what I was looking for. 

Packed full of useful features for users of any type. The audio quality was excellent, fit was very comfortable for wireless earbuds. 

Pros: Waterproofed (note: I did not test these in a pool), active noise cancellation, hear-through capability to help you be aware of surroundings when needed, and a “pass through” mode to allow limited amount of outside sound through when you need it. 

The case can also be plugged in to other devices and used as a transmitter for the headphones for “older” devices with 3.5mm headphone jack. 

I ran into some issues with the app and activating some of the features, but that could be related to my device or something else.

A Reliable Choice for Active Lifestyles,"The Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 is a fantastic choice for anyone seeking high-quality, durable earbuds that cater to an active lifestyle. With a focus on delivering both premium sound and exceptional durability, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 performs remarkably well in most key areas.

Sound Quality

One of the standout features of these earbuds is their impressive sound profile. They deliver deep bass without overshadowing mids and highs, providing a balanced sound that’s perfect for music across genres, podcasts, and calls. Customization through the Jabra Sound+ app allows you to personalize the EQ, ensuring an ideal listening experience for any user.

Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode

The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 is effective at blocking out background noise, making them great for commuting or working out in noisy environments. The transparency mode (HearThrough) is also well-executed, allowing ambient sound in when needed without feeling too overwhelming or unnatural.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A
Great for working out,"These are great earbuds for working out.  While they have never fallen out of my ears when I lean down (say negative sit-ups), they don't stay in as well as when standing up.  When inserted, I have to put it in the right earbud first, or it will not automatically turn on.  If I put in the left earbud first, the bud connects, but the left bud stays off.

Great with okay sound,Sound is okay. I'm not an audiophile. Stays in the ear well when running. Feels more comfortable to wear for long durations than the 75t.

Fantastic swan song for Jabra,"Most comfortable, best sounding no wire headphones I've ever owned, with one major caveat. These are so comfortable I forget that I have them in. No ear rubbing, no bulging on the sides of my ears. The largest size tips occupy my ear perfectly. The material does not slip out of my ear, whether in the gym or on a run, yoga/calisthenics, never had them slip.

The caveat is that your assistant cannot be turned on using the headphones while at the same time being able to control the volume using the headphones. You can, of course, use the assistant to control the volume but cannot use the buttons on the headphones while also having the buttons activate the assistant. 

Since I activate my assistant using voice commands but prefer to control volume physically, I've opted to disable the assistant being called using buttons to retain the volume control functionality. I did not dock a star as this has not diminished my enjoyment of the headphones, but I did waste 30 minutes or so trying to discover why I could not do both.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6582100&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2

Love these Jabras!,"These headphones are finally the ones that have everything I want in wireless headphones.  They fit so comfortably, it's easy to forget I have them on.  My last pair had wingtips for stability in my ear but they hurt my ear!  I read you would just have to get used to them but my ears never did.  I have tried similar style ear buds with touch control but found I like the Jabras better as they have a physical button.  Much better with the tactile feedback over the touch interface.  I haven't had the opportunity to try the smart case option yet, but that is another great option.  I like more bass in my music and was easily able to adjust the sound options in the Jabra app.  These were easy to pair with my android phone.

Best Ear Buds I have used. THEY DO NOT MOVE!,"I was skeptical at first about these ear buds being able to stay in my ear. while I know Jabra makes top quality sound devices, I was not prepared for this experience.

Pros
These FIT like they are part of your ear. I have tried at least 20 different ear buds and none fit like these. I was not sure how they would work but from the first try in the parking lot (did not want to take them home if they did not fit like all the other) I knew these were golden. After a few days of use, these have not once moved from my ear. 
Comfort these are the most comfortable ear buds I have used. As in ear devices they are like they are not even there. Amazing
Sound What a rich and clear sound. With multiple default eq settings and the ability to customize it, the sound is amazing all around in these.
ANC. This is the best ANC I have used in a while. The world disappears when you turn it on. I mean, no sound gets through. Again, amazing

Cons
- There is no ambient sound mode with music. These have a passthrough setting, but the music stops when you activate it.

These are the best ear buds I have owned, and I have tried almost all brands (not beats, I am an Android user and they are mainly apple).

Very good,Im reviewing these earbuds as is.  I didn't end up keeping them but I really wanted to.  Everything about them is excellent.  They look great and feel great. Very durable.  The microwave was good.  I just felt like another pair of earbuds that I kept actually sounded better.  These sounds good!  They aren't bad. If you aren't comparing to any other experience you'll definitely keep them and they probably sound better than most.  Because sound was the main criteria for me.

"Fine in quality, insane QOL decisions","These earbuds leave me conflicted; on one hand they’re very comfortable, durable, and the battery life is great. On the other, there are some design choices that confuse and frustrate me. Firstly, the left earbud can’t work independently, only the right can. Also, since the last set of Jabras I owned, they have REMOVED THE OPTION TO TURN OFF ANC OR HEARTHROUGH. The option is just gone, and the noise cancellation can’t keep up with any significant amount of wind blowing across the microphone (like one would encounter biking or running). So half of the time I can’t hear my music over the sound of the noise cancellation failing. This single issue stops these from being 5 star product all on its own for me, as I can’t use my fitness earbuds for either of my main exercises. Sad to say I dropped almost $250 on a product that feels worse to use than a previous (and less expensive) edition of the same brand.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6582100&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
