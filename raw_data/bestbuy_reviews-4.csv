Don’t Delay on These,"These are great! I had held off for so long and am glad I finally decided to purchase. I use them with my laptop and cell phone and have no connectivity issues. The sound quality is excellent, the noice cancelling works very well, and having multiple earpiece options is a major plus. Additionally, the charge on this seems to last forever which is a huge plus. I plug it in maybe every two days? I also really enjoy that while running they stay in your ears and don’t have to worry about them falling out unlike other brands.

AirPods Pro,"Comfort: 8.5/10 - Very comfortable, doesn’t fall out even with aggressive head movement.

Touch Controls: 10/10 - The functions available for touch control (like volume slider) are useful. Using the touch functions is not hard to figure out. Unlike many other earbuds, you can adjust their angle in your ears without accidentally setting off a touch control.

Noise Cancelling: 10/10 - Works well overall. Amazing for almost completely blocking out consistent background noise, soft noises, and even some harsh noises (ex. tapping on a window).

Transparency Mode: 10/10 - Very good, sounds as though the headphones are not even in your ears.

Sound Quality: 9/10 - Good quality especially in such a small package.

Bass: 9.75/10 - The bass in these earbuds is great.

Battery Life: 8.5/10 - Good, the buds alone lasting a bit longer could be useful. The battery life information provided by Apple is accurate.

Overall, they work well and have many useful features. The earbuds seem to be a good discreet option for daily use.

Excellent for Apple Ecosystem,"I rate these as just a notch below my Sony XM over-the-ear headphones in terms of noise cancellation. They are quite effective in blocking out annoying distractions in noisy environments. My favorite feature is how they switch automatically between iPad, iPhone, and Mac, without having to touch Bluetooth settings. The “Find My” feature works quite well with these, better than the first generation AirPods Pros. They also seem to fit better and stay in place more reliably. About my only gripe is that the charge-state widget could be clearer about the charge condition of the individual buds when you are using one at a time as I often do, exchanging them into the charging case when they get low. 
The USB-C port is nice and has allowed us to ditch our lightning cables.",3,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382?variant=A

My New AirPods!!,"After several months of enjoying the immersive sound and noise cancellation capabilities of my 1st generation AirPods Pro, I was disappointed to lose them. However, this mishap presented an opportunity to upgrade to the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). I made a choice that I never regret.

From the moment I unboxed the 2nd generation AirPods Pro, I noticed the familiar sleek design, promising an extension of the fashion-forward and technologically advanced experience I cherished with my first pair. But it wasn't until I put them to use that I realized just how incredible these earbuds are.

The sound quality has taken a noticeable leap forward. Thanks to the new Adaptive EQ, music feels more alive, enveloping me in layers of sound that I didn't realize were missing before. The bass is deeper, the highs are clearer, and every note feels tuned to perfection, adapting to my ear shape in real-time.

Noise cancellation, a feature I heavily relied on with the 1st generation, has been remarkably improved. The 2nd generation AirPods Pro create an even more serene audio sanctuary, allowing me to fully immerse myself in music or podcasts without the intrusion of external noise. This feature alone makes the upgrade worth it.

The addition of Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is a game-changer. Watching movies and listening to music is now an immersive experience that feels like I'm in the center of the action. The sound moves with me, creating a theater-like atmosphere that has to be experienced to be believed.

Battery life has also seen an improvement, providing up to 6 hours of continuous use with noise cancellation enabled. This is a significant upgrade from the 1st generation, ensuring I stay connected and entertained for longer. The charging case, now compatible with MagSafe and Apple Watch chargers, adds convenience to its functionality.

Perhaps one of the most practical features for someone like me, who has a history of losing earbuds, is the introduction of Precision Finding. The U1 chip in the charging case works with my iPhone to help locate it quickly, offering peace of mind and reducing the chances of another unfortunate loss.

In conclusion, upgrading to the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) has been an overwhelming experience in the best possible way. The improvements in sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life, and additional features like Spatial Audio and Precision Finding, make them a significant step up from the 1st generation. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a movie lover, or someone who appreciates the fusion of fashion and technology, the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) are a worthy investment that will elevate your audio experience to incredible new heights.",4,4,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6447382&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2
A good all-round wireless earbuds,"The build quality is about the same, with no real difference.
The sound quality is really great. I love the conversation Awareness feature vs. transparency mode.

A Pleasant Surprise: AirPods Pro Made My Long Flig,"I’ve never been a fan of in-ear noise-canceling earbuds. The pressure inside my ears and uncomfortable tips always bothered me. As a result, I had never considered buying the AirPods Pro models. However, my kids surprised me with a pair for Mother’s Day, and I was initially skeptical.
During my 23-hour flight to India, I decided to give them a try. To my amazement, they provided a peaceful experience like never before. Here’s what stood out:

Noise Cancellation: The AirPods Pro effectively blocked out airplane sounds. I felt cocooned in silence, which made the long flight much more bearable.

Comfort: Unlike previous earbuds, the AirPods Pro tips were incredibly soft. I didn’t feel any discomfort even after wearing them for hours.
Landing Pressure: Usually, my ears suffer during landing due to pressure changes. But this time, I experienced no discomfort whatsoever.

Air Hostess Interaction: I appreciated the convenience of taking them off when the air hostess came around. The transition from quiet to loud was seamless.

Comfort and Fit: They are incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods. The customizable ear tips ensure a secure fit, and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.

Battery Life: The battery life is impressive. I can get through a full day of use without needing to recharge, and the case provides extra charge cycles.

Easy Pairing: Pairing with my devices is seamless. They connect quickly to my phone, tablet, and laptop, and the Type-C connection ensures a stable link.

Sweat and Water-Resistance: They're sweat and water-resistant, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. I never worry about a sudden rain shower or a sweaty workout damaging them.

You can expect the Active Noise Cancellation to work great while you're traveling on a bus, working in a cafe, or walking in a park. It has a great batter, with and without ANC. The transparency mode is second to none for this price range. And, I love the volume controls on this, which are so precise every single time.

My New AirPods!!,"After several months of enjoying the immersive sound and noise cancellation capabilities of my 1st generation AirPods Pro, I was disappointed to lose them. However, this mishap presented an opportunity to upgrade to the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). I made a choice that I never regret.

From the moment I unboxed the 2nd generation AirPods Pro, I noticed the familiar sleek design, promising an extension of the fashion-forward and technologically advanced experience I cherished with my first pair. But it wasn't until I put them to use that I realized just how incredible these earbuds are.

The sound quality has taken a noticeable leap forward. Thanks to the new Adaptive EQ, music feels more alive, enveloping me in layers of sound that I didn't realize were missing before. The bass is deeper, the highs are clearer, and every note feels tuned to perfection, adapting to my ear shape in real-time.

Noise cancellation, a feature I heavily relied on with the 1st generation, has been remarkably improved. The 2nd generation AirPods Pro create an even more serene audio sanctuary, allowing me to fully immerse myself in music or podcasts without the intrusion of external noise. This feature alone makes the upgrade worth it.

The addition of Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is a game-changer. Watching movies and listening to music is now an immersive experience that feels like I'm in the center of the action. The sound moves with me, creating a theater-like atmosphere that has to be experienced to be believed.

Battery life has also seen an improvement, providing up to 6 hours of continuous use with noise cancellation enabled. This is a significant upgrade from the 1st generation, ensuring I stay connected and entertained for longer. The charging case, now compatible with MagSafe and Apple Watch chargers, adds convenience to its functionality.

Perhaps one of the most practical features for someone like me, who has a history of losing earbuds, is the introduction of Precision Finding. The U1 chip in the charging case works with my iPhone to help locate it quickly, offering peace of mind and reducing the chances of another unfortunate loss.

In conclusion, upgrading to the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) has been an overwhelming experience in the best possible way. The improvements in sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life, and additional features like Spatial Audio and Precision Finding, make them a significant step up from the 1st generation. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a movie lover, or someone who appreciates the fusion of fashion and technology, the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) are a worthy investment that will elevate your audio experience to incredible new heights.",4,4,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382?variant=A&page=2&page=3&pageSize=20&sku=6447382&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A
