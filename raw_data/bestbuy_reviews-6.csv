Unparalleled Audio Experience with Beats Stuido Bu,"Title: Unparalleled Audio Experience with Beats Studio Buds!

Review:

I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds in the striking Beats Red color, and I am absolutely thrilled with my decision! These earbuds have not only met but exceeded my expectations in every possible way, offering an audio experience that's truly in a class of its own.

Firstly, the design of the Beats Studio Buds is sleek and modern, with the Beats Red color adding a vibrant touch that stands out. They are incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods, and the secure fit ensures they stay in place during workouts or on the go.

The noise cancelling feature of these earbuds is a game-changer. It effectively blocks out external noise, allowing me to immerse myself in the music or focus on my calls without any distractions. Whether I'm commuting, in a noisy environment, or just enjoying my favorite tunes at home, the noise cancellation creates a personal oasis of sound.

Sound quality is where the Beats Studio Buds truly shine. The audio is crisp, clear, and balanced, with a depth that brings every song to life. The bass is punchy without being overpowering, and the highs are bright and distinct. Whether I'm listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the sound is consistently impressive across all genres.

The wireless connectivity is flawless, with quick and easy pairing to my devices. The touch controls are intuitive, allowing me to manage playback, answer calls, or activate voice assistance with simple gestures. The battery life is also commendable, providing hours of uninterrupted listening pleasure.

In conclusion, the Beats Studio Buds are a fantastic investment for anyone seeking superior sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design. They have become an indispensable part of my daily routine, enhancing every moment with their exceptional audio performance. If you're in the market for wireless earbuds that deliver on all fronts, look no further than the Beats Studio Buds in Red",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
Awesome buds for music lovers,It’s really good in terms of sound quality and design. It fits for your ears exactly. Never lasted battery and you Can enjoy your music anywhere and anytime without any interruptions,1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
"Long, but worth the read!","Pros: •Sound Quality: best sound I’ve had from headphones in a while. I also appreciate the ability to switch between noise cancellation & transparency mode.  •Size: small enough to fit in most pockets but big enough to remind me I have them in my pocket. •Design: the unique shape fits perfectly in my hands. I also appreciate the variety of colors that are available (I chose red since my iPhone is the same color).
Cons: •The Buds: I’m not sure if it’s a defect or just my ears, but I had a difficult time getting them to stay in my ears, even after switching to the smallest size. •Design: It fits perfectly in my hands, but it is super smooth, making it easy to drop. I’d recommend finding a case, which has proven to be difficult for me. •Doesn’t come with an adapter, just the cord, which is very short (I’ve already lost it).
Overall: I’d still recommend buying. I love them.",5,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
Great… but not amazing,"PROS: Honestly great pair of earbuds. You can go pretty far away from them and they don’t lose connection. You’d think the walls of your home would be a problem, not for these earbuds! Noise canceling is wonderful. So Is the microphone. it’s really good at catching just your voice among all the cluttering noise around you. 
          Connectivity: Be advised BEATS are an Apple owned product and therefore work very well amongst the Apple ecosystem Especially when connecting and disconnecting. 
           Battery Life: these earbuds are insanely good at keeping a charge. A 5 min charge gives you and hour of playback time.
CONS: The only reason I'm giving a 4 is just because recently inside one of my earbuds something came lose and now rattles whenever I listen to music. To be fair I like listening to music loudly, and I think that causes some of the problem.",28,7,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
Good sound quality but awful fit,"Sound quality is great as well as battery life, iPhone connectivity is designed the same way as AirPods, my only issue is the constantly fall of my ears when working out (reason I got them) I even tried the 3 different earbuds sizes they come with but same results. I’ll be returning them.",7,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
A great alternative to AirPod Pros,"I used to have Airpods Gen 2 and currently had AirPod Pros. My Pros started to crackle and since they were out of warranty Apple was charging me to replace the faulty one. Anyways, venturing to look for headphones that were wireless, had active noise cancellation, and played well with the Apple ecosystem was kind of slim pickings. Thankfully these Beats Studio Buds fit my lifestyle perfectly. 

What works? They’re nicely designed albeit kind of odd looking. But once they’re in the ear they’re really comfortable. Sound quality isn’t as good as my Pros but they’re still not shabby - they’re loud and bass-y. The “b” as a button control is pretty dope and it has become second nature after having these for a few days. Then the connectivity, brilliant. They connect just the same as AirPods do - open them up near an Apple device and it’ll connect. Oh, and it’s in the “Find My” app. Active noise cancellation works quite well too, though I haven’t really tried out transparency mode since I don’t like it in general. Finally, they do stay in the ear quite well. I’ve only gone on walks with these but I’m sure they’ll fit quite snug while I’m on a run. 

What doesn’t work? At this price point, it kind of makes sense, but it’s lacking the feature where when you take it out of your ear it pauses. It’s a small gripe, and something I do miss, but it’s not a dealbreaker. Then the case… it’s poorly made and plastic feeling. It’s also really slippery. If one day I drop these and they go down the sewers, well, I wouldn’t be all that surprised. It’s too bad that there’s no wireless charging either. But I guess it’s fine at this price point.

All in all, this will hold me over quite well I imagine while I wait for the AirPod Pros 2. I would recommend these in a heartbeat.",18,4,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A

Best earbuds for the price,"Love these, fit comfortably in my ears, sweat resistant and they don’t fall out. Sound is amazing, you have the option for transparent or quite mode. They also hook up and preform with apple products, due to the A11 chip that’s installed, very convenient.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
Budget ANC wireless Earbuds,"Great set of earbuds, one of my first pair of wireless earbuds and they were great but after a year and couple months the audio seemed to degrade and I feel like it's okay but doesn't bump like it use to. (I HAVE DROPPED THEM MANY TIMES KEEP THAT IN MIND) Battery life is decent for what you pay for. ANC is average but does the job I need to listen to music and podcast casually at work. 

Definitely great budget set though would honestly wouldn't pay more than $100 and now I still own it and use it casually as my second pair. 

Really only negative is the degrading volume over time (1yr plus) and no Custom EQ settings - also no wireless charging (doesn't bother me)",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
Beats earbuds,"Great purchase. They have the best sound I've heard. There earbuds actually fit my ears better than my previous pains.

airpods & studio buds,"So if you are one of those people who were on the fence with these headphones. Allow me to help. So I have all the earbuds and headphones known to man for some reason, but regardless i will say yes these are NOT better than the Airpod Pros, the pros have a little more bass to it, user friendly wigs to it, like how the music will stop if one ear bud isn’t in and etc and overall offer more “bells and whistle” for lack of better term right now….. however though these are pretty nice. Like, really nice. The quality, the clarity in the songs are legit. It is worth the buy, as the main reason for me was i liked how they came in different colors as i prefer the sleek, stealth design the black ones give. But yes they are like a  step below the pros, but for sure worth a try. It took “Avalanche” by Migos and then switched it up to “Waves of Blue” by Majid Jordan to tell me that these are amazing. Buy them. Scan you face on the apple pay…. And… buy… them… your welcome :-)",7,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
Sounds great!,"It is comfortable,  I can use it while exercising but if you sweat a lot like me it might fall out. It is loud and sound is great.  Case is great and it feels good to hold it with a good weight. Charges very fast as well.
Great deal for the price!",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A

3 Weeks Update,Overall it’s a good product. The main issue is that it doesn’t fit in my ears and slips out. Replacing with the bigger tips made that better but still slips out sometimes. Also found that wearing it 90 degree counter clockwise solved this problem almost completely but don’t like how they look that way . The  Sound quality is good overall and great for bass). Connect easily between apple devices. PS. cable is included but not plug.,1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
OUTSTANDING!!!!,"I really love the feel and look of these, I definitely prefer the beats over Apple pros. Definitely love that they came in white so I can match my Apple devices! The price is outstanding for the quality and I was surprised to see they finally came out with what I’ve been wanting, no cords, no wrap around the ear, no attaching one to the other to wrap around the back of your neck. The sound for the phone is crisp and clear, no echo and the listener doesn’t hear most of the background noise; so noise canceling quality is great! Very pleased! The only thing is I expected the music quality to be just a little bit better for these being beats. It’s great tho. Not enough difference to make a fuss over. Also the USB C charger is a nice thing, but doesn’t come with a wall plug, you’ll need something to plug in each end for charging. Both ends is USB-C. I have a MacBook so I’m using that charger for my beats.",14,37,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
Beat Studio Buds are Legit,"The Beat Studio Buds are a great for music the sound is exactly what you need. Battery life is great haven’t ran out of juice on either eat yet. (between be charging the case here and there)
I would recommend these to anyone looking for good sound quality with earbuds.

Fit: I noticed myself that I use a larger fit in my right ear and then the original size (Medium fit) in my left. If they don’t fit your ears switch out the silicone sizes and see what fits for you.


Few things that hold these back right now :

1. When answering calls and using facetime the audio does not switch automatically to your studio buds , you will have to do that part manually. With the Air pods you don’t have that issue.

2. If your adjusting your Studio buds while in your ear you could accidentally hang up/end a call by pressing the (b) beats button. I’ve done it a few times myself and it takes a little practice to adjust them without hanging up on someone.


3. (Opinion) Quality could be a bit better with the Studio buds case . Feels a bit cheap for the Beats brand and i’ve dropped the case on tile and the both buds will fly out occasionally haha. I dropped them (accidentally, again ) in a parking lot but this time the buds did not fly away.",6,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
Amazing Earbuds,"The beat buds were amazing. Best of quality, and crystal clear sound. Enjoyed listening to music at the highest setting and the sound is just fine. Best Buy delivered the product to my house immediately after I ordered it online and I’m very happy with purchase highly recommend it. And its much cheaper than most overly expensive headphones/earbud brands. It’s definitely worth every penny for the price your paying. Very great gift as well, highly recommend this purchase! Beautiful design as well :)",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
Totally Amazing Out of this World Earphones,"The Dr. Dre - Beats Studio Buds Totally Wireless Noise Cancelling Earphones are absolutely AMAZING.  The sound quality compares to being in a sound studio.  The noise cancelling makes wearing these while running or working out, seem like you are in a world by yourself.  And the final fabulous quality: I finally have a pair of earphones that actually stay in my ears.  Once you put them in the correct ears (the buds indicate L and R for left and right), and turn the b lever, it is like they magically lock into your ears.  The case is a WOW factor as well.  Each bud fits perfectly in its own section. The buds stay put as they are held in the case via magnet. I am in love.  The BEST Best Buy purchase for earphones.",32,7,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
THE BEATS WIRELESS EAR BUDS ARE WORTH IT,Very good pair of noise canceling ear buds. Battery life last a good amount of time and good sound quality.

Great 2nd Pair of TWS Earbuds,"First off I am surprised at this new release from Beats (Apple). I wasn't expecting the sound to be as it is. Usually the boomy bass and muddy mids is what you get from Beats, except this time it has been improved and it resembles a more refined sound with enough bass and better audio presentation. The design of Earbuds is not new to me as I feel Beats (Apple) borrowed the design of the Earin A-3 but with eartips added. Still this is a more comfortable and secure fit than my AirPods Pro. My Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are my most comfortable and extended listening pair and the ones I tend to pick up more. The AirPods Pro are 2nd to none in the clarity and call department. We can't get Audiophile Sound from TWS just yet although technology has improved tremendously but until then these are some of the few earbuds I use for TWS earphones. I have some EarFun Free Pro's, just pre-ordered the Life P3's as well but for now... These Beats Earbuds will suffice and I would definitely recommend to anyone beit iOS or Android user!",2,2,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A
