Amazing for the price!,"These earbuds are really good for just about $100, punchy and deep bass is really good and aound quality is very rich. Some fine tuning in the app definitely can make a difference. Call quality is also excellent and people can hear me clearly. The easy switching between noise canceling and pass through is a breeze and can make hearing others while listening to music a simple push of a button.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A,1
Sony’s Bang for the Buck!,"If you are a millennial, you might remember the Brand Sony for their stereos and walkmans. These cheap Bluetooth active noise cancelling TWS earphones remind me of that simple era.

They are compatible with an iphone but their true potential of auto connection is explored by an Android device.

They fit my large ears perfectly for that Noise cancelling seal. Smaller ear people might need to change the buds to a different size provided.

Noise cancelling is as good as the expensive ones. They do dull out the back ground hum of an airplane. Do not expect the performance of the fruit brand. Keep in mind the price you are paying and the value you are getting at this price point.

Impressive earbuds,"Excellent earbuds. Purchased this recently as my phone no longer supported my wired earbuds, and was instantly converted to the side of wireless earbuds.

"GREAT SOUND, PRICE, AND COMFORTABLE","These sound really good out of the box but the app makes them way better. They also really comfortable i feel like i could sleep with them. The noise cancelling is pretty good too. They sound better than the beats for around the same price ,the beats over time will develop a problem that causes the left earbud to stop charging and is a know issue apple won't do anything about it...lets see if how sony holds up over time.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A,1
Decent wireless ear buds,"This is a DECENT pair of headphones ear buds considering the price. They work well indoors when on the phone, outside not so great. The noise canceling feature is fickle.

Great budget earbuds.,"These are great for a budget the active noise canceling is good enough. 
The pros is if you have a Sony Xperia phone the seamless integration is really cool. On the side sense you can see the Sony WF-7OON, on the information displaying like sitting and moving with adjusting the equalizer. These are very light earbuds compared to Sony flagship models that were very heavy and felt like they would fall off my ears. The active noise canceling does not provide good aware mode so often I cannot hear my colleagues talking to me or when I am driving my car I cannot hear the flow of traffic, I need some good earbuds that offer a way to adapt to local surroundings.
What are the cons on these earbuds are the battery case life capacity is 12 hours. Not very long in the earbuds world. I was surprised to see that the case has depleted it reserves after me using these earbuds for 2 days in a work environment of about 4 hours per day.",2,3,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A,0

Amazing earbuds held back by just the tips,"Excellent sound that are five star worthy, but these are held back by the ear tips they come with. Uncomfortable and aren't secure at all if you've got small ear canals like me. If you replace them (I went with comply), the sound quality at this price point is easily top tier.

Solid buds at a great price,"These Sony buds are fantastic and offer a lot of bang for the buck.  I replaced my daily drivers of 2 years with these and can tell you they don't feel budget to me at all.  

Box contains the pillbox looking charging case, buds and a USB C cable.  As I already have the Sony music app, pairing was a breeze.  I do recommend downloading the app so you can take full advantage of what the buds can offer.  I absolutely love Equalizer and not only can use the presets it comes with, but also my own preference but adjusting lows, mids and highs manually. 

Sound quality is excellent.  I have no complaints while watching movies, playing mobile games or listening to my library from metal to classical.  
Comfort is surprisingly great as well.  I am using the medium tips that were preinstalled and they fit nice and snug.  No discomfort from a 8 hour desk job and also at the gym while running on the treadmill.  
With that being said, battery life just keeps going.  1 gripe is that when you charge the case, it'll turn from red to green in real time, but the app won't update the % until you replace the buds and take them out again.  I used them in a 9 hour shift and they lasted all day, only having to charge it during my 1 hour lunch break.

Noise cancellation works well and so does the pass through.  Quite shocked for a pair of buds that are considered budget.  While on, I would clap or snap my fingers close to my ears and would barely hear it at all.

If you are looking at ear buds in the $100 price range and want the best, here they are.  Sony did an absolute rock solid job on these and I would definitely recommend them in a heartbeat.",3,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,0
Listen Up! Feature Packed Sony Wireless Earbuds!,"The feature rich Sony WF-C700N Wireless Earbuds (truly wireless, noise canceling, Bluetooth) are a great companion for the active lifestyle.
Whether it’s outside, inside the gym or mowing the lawn, I enjoy workouts in several places throughout the week.  I always use earbuds for music to make the time go by faster while exercising (and protection from the lawn mower noise).  This time, I was fortunate enough to use Sony’s new WF-C700N wireless earbuds.  With just a Bluetooth connection and music streaming service on my smart phone to the Sony WF-C700N wireless ear buds, I am ready to go! 
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come in a very small plastic case that will easily fit in your front pocket.  It is a bit slippery trying to hold on to it while opening it.  Once the case is opened you can easily remove the earbuds which are magnetically held in place.  When it is time to put the earbuds back in the case the same magnets snap them correctly into place.  A few other positives things about the case is the IPX4 rating, meaning it is splash/sweat proof (not waterproof).  In total you get around 15 hours of playtime when using the case (7.5 hours) to recharge the earbuds within the case (7.5 hours).  It takes about 1.5 hours to completely charge.   Each earbud separately has its own charge that is used while listening (it is displayed in the Sony App).  An USB Type A to a USB Type C connection, charges up the case.  The cord is really short so charging has to be done close to the source of power.  If the shortness of the cord is a negative, the charging of the case for 10 mins is a positive, which will give you 1 hour of playtime.
The earbuds are comfortably ergonomically made with three sizes of removable buds to allow for your best fit (small, medium, large). The buttons on the earbuds are big and easy to press for all the different modes making a slight digital beep when turn on/off.  This was a nice convenient surprise which made navigating the track, phone calls, noise canceling and pausing really pleasant.  
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come equipped with Sony’s DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine).  This process upgrades the music from any source from good to better and replicates the music the way the artist intends.  You can actually get CD quality sound or really close to it.
The WF-C700N wireless earbuds can connect to the Sony App for a major experience of informative fun. Use your smart phone’s camera on the QR Code after opening the box.  The link will appear for you go to download Sony’s App in which you select the correct product you are intending to use.  The App will help take pictures of your left ear then the right ear.  Analysis of these pictures will help you get the best sound possible out of your earbuds according to your ears.  The Sony App has an activity log/merit badge, time used with earbuds, an EQ, Ambient Noise Control, Adaptive Sound Control (actually saves and remembers your settings while automatically applying them to where you are!), any firmware updates and access to 360 Reality Audio Setup!  
The best feature, in my opinion is the 360-degree reality audio experience.  The music sweeps around your head space with “24 adaptive object-based points in a soundstage” like an atmosphere.  This creates an amazing experience when hooked up to a streaming music service that supports 360 Reality Audio: Tidal, Amazon Music Unlimited, Artist Connection, Nugs.net, PeerTracks.  Now at the moment Spotify doesn’t have premium above 320kbps, but it still is enhanced with these WF-700N wireless earbuds (not using the 360 Reality Audio).  While Stereo sound is great, eventually in my opinion, it will be replaced by 360 Reality Audio with more companies in the not-so-distant future.  The sound, like a “live concert,” or just listening to the different points all around you is simply amazing!  It is the best way to enjoy music.  The highs are clear and precise while the mids are solid and strong.  The bass is thumping but very accurate (20Hz-20kHz frequency range for earbuds).  The Sony App will guide you through the steps to take for the streaming service and 360 Reality Audio Setup. (You will have to create at one account in the process.)  
Last but not least, the large mics are in the front of the earbuds that give you better clarity and realism with the Ambient Noise Control off even with the music on (also aids better hearing/speaking in phone calls!).  You can also have two paired devices, like a smart phone or laptop that you can switch between without having to reset the Bluetooth every time. 
I really thoroughly enjoyed the Sony WF-C700N truly wireless noise canceling in-ear Bluetooth earbuds.  The Active Noise Canceling worked really well as did the comfortable fit, Sony App and 360 Reality Audio.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,0
Solid performer at a good price,"The Sony WF-C700N earbuds with noise canceling deliver good performance for the price. I have them in sage color that is soft on the eyes and gives them a more modern look. 

Setup requires downloading the Sony earphones app. Instructions are easy to follow and Bluetooth connection was problem free. The app is easy to navigate. Lots of options to configure the sound with an equalizer and other digital sound processes, and to customize the buttons. I quickly felt comfortable navigating the app and customizing the earbuds to my liking.  

The case is rechargeable through a usb-c connection; no wireless charging is offered. You can monitor the charge on the app. It charges the  earbuds quickly. From my experience, I was able to do about five full charges of the earbuds when they were running very low. 

The earbuds sound really good for the price. I own some high-end earphones and they come close; the highs are clear and not too straining, the mids are not too present and the bass is solid. I also listen to podcasts and they reproduce the vocals quite well. The noise canceling feature works great and mutes the outside distraction effectively. I use them more at work and wear them most of my workdays. I play different kinds of music and podcasts at 60% volume between 5 to 6 hours at a time. The batteries handle that easily; I usually have about 25-30% of charge left after those marathon sessions. They’re light and sit well outside the ear canal and are comfortable to wear for long hours. Those are regular earbuds and not made for exercise. They sit tight in your ear but they will fall off if you keep moving your head abruptly. Overall, the sound performance is solid.

The only gripe I have is that they require registration and music streaming subscription to take advantage of the Sony 360 Reality Audio. Music streaming such as Amazon Music and Tidal are compatible with the 360 Reality Audio. My subscribed music streamer does not support it unfortunately and I’m not able to experience it for now.

To conclude, I will say that besides not being able to exploit the full capabilities of those earbuds, I’m impressed with their sound quality, battery and noise canceling performances. I would describe the Sony WF-C700N earbuds as mid level earphones at an accessible price that deliver close to high end performance.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,0
Solid Offering Below Sony's TOTL,"The Sony - WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling In-Ear Headphones are solid & affordable option for anyone shopping for ear buds that are markedly less expensive than Sony's top-of-the-line models.

Pairing and setup was easy across the three different mobile devices I use; a Galaxy S23+ - a Sony NW-ZX707 Walkman and an Xperia Pro-I.  The Sony headphone app is well designed and easy to use, making the process of setting up the WF-C700Ns very easy and intuitive to do.  One thing I noticed with these particular buds is that the firmware update process was much quicker to apply & complete vs. my other Sonys.  Hats off to Sony for improving that facet!

The sound quality is highly customizable with the Sony app and no matter if you use one of many EQ profiles or simply leave it entirely off - the these ear buds sound fantastic than the lower-tiered Sony offerings of just a few years back.

Everyone's hearing profile and preferences are different but I personally find the Sony 'Excited' preset to perform the best - no matter the genre of music listened to.

The app gives clearly understandable status of the battery levels for each individual 'bud', along with the charging case.

These noise cancelling in-ear headphones punch well above their pay grade.  Clean & clear treble, solid & articulate midrange and plenty of well executed base.  Certainly not the best noise cancelling performance I've experienced but definitely good and more than adequate.

I like the way these fit compared to ANY of the other Sony ear buds I own or have tried.  There are light weight, well balanced and they stay-put!

My only gripe is the communication lag between the mechanical button functions and the device being used.  But this is a small nit and considering the price point, it's acceptable.  Capacitive touch buttons would have been appreciated but I get why those special features are assigned to the higher-end products from Sony.

These are solid for what they list price for and will be even more attractive on-sale.

Pros:
Excellent sound quality
Good noise cancellation performance
Plenty of volume, clarity & bass punch
Very comfortable to wear and they do 'stay put'
Really like the Sony Headphone app that gives good status levels and ease of control
Excellent set of pre-set EQ settings to choose from and the ability to manual contour your own profile
Didn't experience any connection issues or drop in sound quality
Battery life appears to be per-spec

Cons:
Not a huge fan of the integrated, mechanical buttons - but they do work
No 'ear sensors' to automatically put your listening on pause
Despite these two cost saving configuration features, I didn't penalize the score
You get what you pay for...",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1
Great sound for a fair price,"I have several wireless earbuds, including another pair of Sony brand ones. These WF-C700N earbuds, or as they call them, in-ear headphones, have great sound! For the price point I am impressed. 

Everything you need to get started with these is in or on the small box. For instructions on how to use these, scan the QR code included. The paperwork inside the little box is just legal and safety stuff. Download the Sony Headphones app to get more out of these earbuds. There is a flush but pressable button on each earbud, something I like because when these earbuds have several functions and you are supposed to touch them a certain way, I tend to not use those functions. I like to wear these for working out. I wear both earbuds for that, and I don’t press the buttons by accident when I might lay my head on the floor (yoga, etc.) or put my arm next to my ear by accident, I don’t mess up the sound or change anything, which is nice. I also like to wear these with just one earbud at a time. Right now as I’m writing, I have just the left one in, listening to some music. Some earbud sets don’t function well this way or at all, but these do. These earbuds are also water resistant, although I haven’t really tested that with anything other than a bit of sweat, and they seem fine in that regard.

Battery life is a non-issue for me, knowinging that these are supposed to have 15 hours of battery life. That’s plenty of time for me. A USB-A to USB-C cable is included for charging. The charging case feels nice in hand, it’s just short of 3” long and the circumference is 4.5” . It looks like a black capsule. I haven’t been able to find information on this, but I think the case and most of the plastic would be mostly recycled materials, as is the case with my other pair of Sony earbuds. There are three sizes of ear tips included. Those are easy to pop on and off to see which ones you like the most. Even though I have small ears, the medium ones fit me nicely. These also don’t fall out of my ears or hurt, which can be an issue for some. Sony makes great products, and these are no exception. Great sound and they are customizable to your preferences.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1
Budget friendly and balanced features.,"Sony - WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling In-Ear Headphones - Black

Summary:
High quality sound in a budget friendly, light, convenient, and comfortable package.

Pros:
* Price-point.  The price is spot on for the features of these earbuds. I think these offer great value.
* High-quality sound.  Surprisingly crisp sound AND effective noise cancellation.
* Form factor is thoughtfully designed.  No protruding plastics. No weird imbalanced weight.
* Right sized charging case.  While not wirelessly charged, the case is the right size and charges the earbuds quickly.  I haven't owned them long enough to see how many charging cycles it can sustain without itself being charged.
* Comfortable.  Due to the size, these fit perfectly in the ears and don't tire out the canals (if that makes sense).
* The controls are responsive, but you cannot fall asleep with them because the buttons might be depressed (depending on how you sleep).

Cons:
* Can't answer calls via Siri voice commands or use Siri at all.
* Need two apps to configure the earbuds.  One for the earbud advanced configuration, and another for the Live 360 Audio sound configuration.

Use:
I've had these a few days and I can say that I love them.  The sound and comfort easily beat the leading competing fruit brand.  

I have had a few pairs of earbuds over the years.  After replacing the fruit branded ones twice due to constant malfunction, I decided it was time to replace them with another brand.  Sony has been a consistent brand for audio in our home (we own some portable speakers of theirs) and thought we'd try their earbuds out.

"Incredible range, superb bass response!","Sony hit is out of the park again with the WF-C700N Wireless Noise Canceling Ear Buds!

I've been a life-long fan of Sony products, and here they continue to deliver on that tradition. They have been known for their 'Mega Bass' for years, and these small ear buds deliver a huge punch for the size. Opening the eco-friendly packaging, no plastics, but recycled cardboard throughout, you get a minimalist design for these ear buds. A charging cord, instructions and a couple of different sized ear tips are all that are in the package. 

There is one multifunction button on each side and you do have to read the instructions and memorize the number of presses to control the ear buds. Initially, setting them up was a little bit of a challenge. Holding down the buttons looking for the bluetooth lights, I didn't get any, like you would when normally pairing bluetooth products. 

Instead, you need to download the Sony Headphones app, which makes pairing and controlling them so much easier. Once downloaded, you can pair the headphones fairly easily - I say this because it still took two attempts for them to be fully recognized. This is my reason for docking one star in the review, as the initial out of the box experience wasn't straightforward like other bluetooth products I've used/paired with - they weren't intuitive. 

HOWEVER - once paired, the experience gets exponentially better. You have complete control over how the ear buds sound. You are taken through a listening experience in the app, where you are given options of what you are listening to, to absolutely fine tune the listening experience. You don't just have a 3 stage equalizer (bass, mid, high), it's 5 stages, but guides you through, playing music, and offering deep preference options. I was really impressed with that. 

Pressing the buttons on the ear buds gives you control over the volume, track playing, play, pause, and also the active noise canceling. You can enhance the sounds around you, so that you can still be aware of your surroundings, or you can 'cancel' them out and become fully immersed in your music. And talking of that, the bass that these tiny ear buds puts out is stellar. Very impressed that something so small can produce this amount of bass. Very impressive. 

They also have the ability to adapt the noise canceling functionality on the go. So for example, if you are sitting at your desk, you can have the noise canceling active, but when you stand up and move around, it activates the heightened listening, so that you can still hear your music but be aware of your surroundings. Go back to your desk and they revert to full noise canceling again. Great feature you never knew you needed, but so valuable. 

And range while walking around, is so impressive! I have a 4000sqft house, my office is in the middle of the house. I was able to walk upstairs and downstairs without any loss of signal from my phone, where other headphones I use would have dropped signal. I was really impressed with the distance I could walk away from my phone, with solid connectivity at all times! 

Overall - apart from the pairing issue at the very beginning, and not knowing if they were powered on or not (no lights or indicators on the ear buds), they have been an incredible set of ear buds and will become my go-to set to use daily. 

And talking of that - you can pair to more than one product (up to two) with this. So you can have them connected to your computer AND your phone at the same time, and they will select between the two as you receive phone calls or as you work. 

I have no hesitation in recommending these ear buds. Great product!",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,0
Disappointed.,Stopped working within a month of purchase. Not recommended.,3,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1
Affordable Sony Noise Canceling Earbud,"I've been looking for true wireless noise canceling headphones for a while now and haven't been able to find a pair with great sound, comfortable to wear, affordable and are packed with features.  The hope was the Sony WF-C700N Noise Canceling earbuds would be the answer…and they are!

Sony’s packaging is top-notch and well thought out to protects the product and it’s all recycled material. The first thing I noticed upon opening the box was the small size of the WF-C700N earbuds.  I’ve tried a number of other earphones and have found some to be too large for everyday use/running/biking.  These earbuds are very small in comparison.   

In the box: 
The earbuds, charging case, charging cable and S, M and L earpieces and paperwork/quick start guide.

Set Up & Performance:
In terms of a quick start guide, it's pretty straight forward.  The earphones essentially connected to my iPhone 13 Pro as soon as I took them out of the charging/carry case.  I already have the Sony Headphone App installed on my phone for a pair of over-the-ear Sony headphones.  Once connected through the app, there was a firmware update that needed to be run.  It took a few minutes and then the earphones were ready to use.

The buds came with a medium sized fitment attached and they seemed to fit pretty well, so I fired up some tunes to see what they’re all about.  After walking around a bit, I noticed the right earbud was somewhat loose and had to readjust it a couple of times.  They are meant to be inserted and twisted into a “locked” position within the ear.  Initially I wasn’t inserting the earphones firmly enough, so the fitment issue was a “user error”.

The sound quality is good, but was lacking that rich bass sound expected from Sony.  At this point I used the Sony app to see what adjustments could be made to the sound quality.  The app is feature-rich and has a bunch of sound adjustments in the form of pre-programmed equalizer settings.  With a couple adjustments, I was able to correct the sound and add a little extra bass.  There are a number of setups  and controls to try…so most users will get the sound setup they are after.  The app also provides settings for the ambient sound/noise cancelling features, auto power off, changing button function on the earbuds, etc.

Phone calls sounded crisp and clear, these earphones have definitely become my go to solution when on the go for the phone feature alone.  

Next, I ran a quick 3 miles to see if they would hold in place and sound the same outside. The sound quality was great outdoors and the ambient settings are great allowing the user to select how much of the outside world comes through.  The connection was solid from both my iPhone and my Apple Watch. Now I can run with just my watch and these headphones and still stay in touch with the outside world...if wanted!  

Pros:
 - great quality Sony construction, fit and functionality
 - Noise Cancelling / Ambient settings
 - Easy to setup and use right out of the box with or without the Sony Headphones app
 - Included portable charging case for additional battery life and carrying on the go
 - Phone calls are easy to manage and excellent sound quality
 - Strong Bluetooth - Never lost connection, even when going in other rooms in my house 
 - One of the smallest truly wireless headphones out there
 - Great value

Cons: 
 - Earbuds did move around in my ear a bit, seemed to not want to “lock” into place that easily 

I would highly recommend these truly wireless headphones if you're looking for great sounding, comfortable headphones that have plenty of features and support phone calls. The addition of noise cancelling is an added bonus!",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf-c700n-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-in-ear-headphones-black/6538256?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6538256&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,0

Top Notch Earbuds,"These earbuds are one of my favorite. They have a great fit and sound. Overall a good improvement from the last generation. Most importantly, the transparency mode and ive ANC has been improved.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,1
Rugged earbuds that stay in place with strong ANC,"Based on the performance, features, and functionality of the Jabra Elite 8 Gen2 wireless headphones, these are my new standard that all other wireless headphones will be compared against.  

In the box are the headphones, wireless charging case, 3 sizes of ear tips, and a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, with a 3.5mm aux crossover adaptor. While not required, you'll want to install the Jabra Sound+ app to maximize functionality and customization. To pair, push both earbuds for 3 seconds and select in your device's Bluetooth options. The headphones will connect to two devices, and uses Bluetooth 5.3 for stable connectivity. The earbuds will also connect to and stream from any Smartwatch that supports HFP, A2DP, or AVRCP Bluetooth profiles. One significant plus is that you can use the case for streaming when Bluetooth is unavailable or not preferred, assuming you have an 3.5mm port to plug into.  I've used this option with gym equipment, CD player, and a gaming desktop. I was impressed with the quality via case streaming, and found that these earbuds also do a great job with gaming sound. 

After setup, the app is where you'll want to go to customize settings, set pass through levels, control Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), adjust the 5 channel EQ or use one of the 6 preset options, configure tap control functions, and access resources such as firmware, warranty, and product help pages. See photos for reference. 

The first thing I noticed after unboxing was that the build felt both polished and durable.  The case has a single hinge that is approximately 50% the length of the case, allowing the lid to flip up and out of the way, but with enough friction to hold the lid open. The case has an LED indicator on it for pairing and charging visuals. The headphones themselves are small, and may take a bit to get used to if you have larger hands, the upside is that they magnetically lock into the case, so you don't risk dropping them or not getting them seated in the case to charge. I found that the sleek coating on the headphones make them a bit harder to grip getting out of the case, but the upside is that they fit snugly, securely, and comfortably into the ear. On the face of each earbud is a sensor for audio and call control. This is customizable, and is fairly standard with one, two, three tap as well as press and hold control options. The headphones offer all standard and expected functionality with call control, music control, ANC control, Spotify quick access, and voice assistant. 

As for software, the ANC is fantastic in comparison to other wireless earbuds, I can tell a significant difference going from HearThrough to ANC, even with no music playing, due to the wide frequency band of noise cancellation. The spatial sound is outstanding, and includes Dolby Audio. The big difference here is that the sound feels like it's coming from external speakers, not in your ear, for an immersive and natural listening experience.  The music audio quality is second to none when it comes to earbuds, the bass feels rich and not over driven, and during gaming I can hear footsteps and nuances I don't even hear as clearly in some of my gaming headphones. The microphone technology is fantastic and picks up my voice without any distortion or ambient noise during calls, even outdoors in windy to crowded environments. 

A few other points to note, the earbuds can be used individually or together, the case can be charged via the included USB cable or fast charged wirelessly, and the battery life is fantastic with multiple days of use in one charge. The ANC is great for blocking noise, especially doing outdoor chores such as mowing while still being able to quickly take calls without having to stop what I'm doing. Lastly the comfort is also stellar, I can wear these all day without having to reposition, they  stay in place during workouts as well as while walking or bike riding.  One other favorite feature is that they are easy to clean. I can take a wet cloth / cleaning wipe to them after workouts or using them outside during chores, dry them off, and put them in the case for next time, zero issues due to being waterproof. 

After a week of use, these are by far my new favorites based on the sound quality, ease of use, great ANC, and the fact that they stay in place, no matter how much I move.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,1
Sturdy and long lasting,"I have had many Jabra wireless headphones throughout the years and my original pair that I have still work and I continue to use them to this day.  These Active 8 Gen 2’s are yet another step forward in Jabra’s wireless ear bud evolution.  These aren’t the best they make but they are sturdy and can take a beating.  They also sound great and one of the coolest features is the ability to use the case as a headphone connection to either a 3.5mm source or a USB-C source.   This comes in very handy when I just need a quick wireless connection w/o a BT connection.   I found that it works very well with no detectable latency.   Ear fitment with the medium tips fit me perfectly, but there are a small and large tip set also included.  The rubberized coating makes these easy to grip and I found that they stayed in my ears well during my run/walks on the treadmill.  I did have to adjust once in a while, but at no point did they fell like they were going to fall out.  They don’t have touch controls, but they have physical buttons that you have to push, I don’t mine this as it makes it easy to adjust them if needed w/o having to activate a touch sensitive button.   Multipoint connection is also a great feature, I have my laptop and my phone connected and I can easily switch between the connections as needed.   Using the Jabra Sound+ app is a must if you want to get the most out of these.  You can adjust the hear through, spatial sound, EQ settings, firmware upgrades, find my Jabra, and much more.  Battery life is rated at 8 hours and 3 extra charges with the case.  I have been using them as much as possible this past week and a half and the charge is 100% on the ear buds and the case is down to 70%.  One downside is that this case doesn’t provide wireless Qi charging.   The 6 microphones that these ear buds have really work well and call quality is great from what I am told, and the active Noise Cancellation reduces the outside noise by about 70-80% I would say.  These also have a 1-year warranty on defects or workmanship and a 2-year dust and water resistance warranty.   Overall, great sound, durability, long battery life, and the smart charging case make this a very good option and with my past experience with Jabra products, its one that I expect to last me a very long time.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,0
Versatile with Great Noise Cancellation,"The Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 earphones, have been designed and built to withstand tough conditions, while still delivering decent quality sound, and as promised, they deliver. They are tough and suitable to be used outdoors, but of course you can also enjoy it indoors similarly to other high-quality earphones. You could be doing some intense activity or just relaxing, you may want complete noise cancellation or hear others while still listening to your tunes or answering a call, it doesn’t matter, these earphones adjust to your needs swiftly. So, there you have it, earphones that you can carry with you for almost any activity. With a long-lasting battery and the case ready to charge, you’ll have no problems going anywhere and not worry too much about running out of juice. I’d recommend the Jabra Elite 8 to anyone looking for a versatile, but still good quality sounding, pair of earphones.

>> Additional comments
I haven’t tested extensively under dust and water (sweat), but in my limited testing with wearing this doing exercise and some light rain, they performed well. So, I’d confirm they are suitable for sports and being active outside. The charging case looks durable, adding an additional layer of protection to the already tough earphones. The only complaint I have is that the earbuds would slide off somewhat easily when doing some intense activity (the motion plus the sweat I’d imagine, with the sweat being the main factor).
The carrying/charging case has an additional 3.5 mm input adapter (tied to an USB-C if you need USB-C), and you can use it to connect the case to a device that doesn’t have Bluetooth, then you can pair your earbuds to it. This looks very handy, and I am looking forward to my next trip and enjoy whatever entertainment the airlines provide me.
In terms of Software, the App available Jabra Sound+ App, and I installed the Android version. It is very intuitive, easy to configure and change the different settings. I installed the App on a Spanish locale Android phone, and the different explanations and descriptions look clear and spot on for the most part, the only thing I noticed so far is that HearThrough was left untranslated (well it doesn’t hinder the usability of the App). The App shows the battery levels for each earbud and for the case, and this might be one of the most useful aspects of the App as it lets me know whether to charge or not before leaving. All other settings, such as ANC are also reachable from within the App. There is also a Spotify playback option that I still need to configure and I look forward to using it.
To change the Sound mode, you can use the App as well as the earbuds. By pressing the side of the left earbud, you can “click” and cycle through the different modes. One interesting aspect is that you can choose to use Pink Noise to overcome complete silence. The one sound mode I love is the Active Noise Cancellation, which works great under noisy environments. The other mode I use frequently is the HearThrough one, comes in handy when talking to people directly and on the phone.
In terms of comfort, I’d say they are comfortable enough to wear that I could spend hours, even without listening to anything.
Power wise, this set outperforms others that I’ve own, between the long-lasting battery of the earbuds themselves, the case, with its rapid charge for busy/active people, provides enough power for a couple of days of use.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,1
Major Improvements to an already Perfect Product!,"I currently use, well now used amd passed on to my wife, the Jabra Elite 8 Gen 1 ear buds, so, when Jabra said here comes Gen 2, I had to try them out.

First I have to note the best got better, and that is the boise canvelling  The Gen 1 set already had amazing noise cancelling but sometimes would take a few minutes to kick in, and if you mowed with your Gen 1 set  you would have noticed after a few minutes  the sound adjusted and noise cancelking became active. Now, with the Gen 2, they are instant, no waiting. I also noticed while weed whipping, the Gen 1s would allow a tad of the cutting of weeds sound come through once in a while, Gen 2 lets nothing through. The Noise Cancelling is so good on these Gen 2 earbuds, i can honestly say the immersion level of music and movie watchjng or even scrolling social media videos on dfferent platforms is so mucj better. 

Fitment is spot on as good as Gen 1, i feel there is zero difference there, just super comfortable amd can wear for hours on end with no needing of breaks from them. The physical push buttons are my favorite, some may not like they have to push buttons, myself, i love this, no unwanted touches like you get with other ear buds.

Next up is the Dolby support, these spund great with Dolby activated on my smart phone or laptop. Movies, games, music (especially live) and phone conversations sound amazing with Dolby on and do without as well. The Gen 2 Active 8s have a great even sound out if the box. Testing with no adjustments to the equalizer on my devices, they sound a tad clearer than Gen 1, highs are not tinny, mids are clear and unmuffled, and bass hits low but does not blow your ear drums doing so. With the adjustments in my eqalizers, I found you can really open these up to sounding much closer to studio headphones without the reference bass, instead the bass seems to cut off at about 43hz and tone down from there. 

I did try the Smart Case Spatial feature with my old tablet to see how it worked and I can confirm it works but not as well as the built in Dolby. I may be doing sowmthung wrong or not understanding it but to be honest, it is not what sold me on these, Jabra's quality and amazing customer service is what keepa me coming back to Jabra, period.

Great job Jabra, you have a customer for lofe with such great ear buds.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,0
Pretty tough,"Jabra has stepped up here. These ear buds are pretty sweet. Out of the box they come with the charging case, the two earbuds, 3 sets of different sized ear gels, and a usb to usb-c cable. The ear gels that were already installed from the factory fit me great so I didnt try on the others. The case is nice and flat shaped to fit in your pocket better. Some competitors still arent doing this for some reason. These come with an impressive 2 year warranty. This was a great sign. 
The bluetooth connection is strong. I can walk around my 20x30 shop with my phone in the corner and have zero connection issues. I wore and used these over a 3 day period without a need for charging. I used them at the gym, during my runs, and at the office with fantastic results. The phone quality was great, people said it sounded like I was just on the phone in a quiet area, but I was outside most of the time. The adjustable noise canceling is a great option (in the app), I could choose how much outside noise I wanted to come through or not. Be sure to download the jabra app to get the full benefits of these buds. There is even a EQ to dial in the sound quality to your liking. 
I forgot to mention how easy the initial connection was, straight out of the case and they were in set up mode, no need to hold a specific button down or anything, super easy.
The audio sounds great with crisp highs and decent lows. These have spatial dolby audio, I was very happy with the music listening, podcasts, phone calls and even a movie.",1,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,0
Excellent Heavy Duty Earbuds,"My last gym headset broke, and I needed a replacement. While I wouldn't say I don't like in-ear earbuds because I fear falling, I am very impressed with the new Jabra Tough earbuds. After a few days of heavy use, these are high-end quality with handy features, such as waterproof (not just water resistance) and military-grade durability. The earbuds feel very rugged and, at the same time, are very comfortable to wear even for prolonged use. The material's design and quality help them resist crushed or mishandled drops. The sound quality delivered is excellent. It features a balanced sound profile and decent customizable equalization (EQ). I frequently customize the mids and boost treble/bass using the app. The earbuds do an excellent job of rendering quality sound across a broad music spectrum. The noise cancellation is incredible; to relax or have quiet time in my house, I use these earbuds and listen to relaxing soundscapes, such as waterfalls, ocean, or rain The smart charging case includes a USB-C charging cable with an AUX adapter to connect the earbuds to any aux connection device, such as a Walkman or cassette tape. This AUX-to-case connection allows music into the buds from gym equipment, airplane monitors, etc. The earbuds are comfortable, stay in the ear, and enable me to wear them for hours without discomfort. Overall, I am delighted with these earbuds.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,1
"Great fit, case connection is so useful","Upgrading from previous generation Jabra, the upgrade in the case makes it worthy.

I like how these fit my ears and stay in place comfortably for hours.

Like other Jabra models, these have a very rich sound. Adjusting the sound profile via the app lets me find the right amount of bass and sound clarity.
Being an ‘active’ model, these are waterproof and great at resisting dust.

Jabra has been making headsets longer than anyone else and also one of the first earbuds. They've been refining this for many years and this model shows. Each earbud has several microphones and configurable side tone (almost of own voice heard back through the headphones), making it a more natural conversation, with adjustable wind noise control.
ANC and sound awareness (HearThrouh) are configurable through the app and can be activated by pressing the left earbud. They can also be used in 'mono' mode by wearing either one while the other is on the case.

The new feature on these ‘Gen 2’ models is the case: It’s very thin and can be charged wirelessly or via USB-C, and when connecting the USB-C cable to a computer or tablet, it works as an USB audio device (does not require Bluetooth), and not only that, the cable has a 3.5mm audio plug that can be used on a treadmill or airplane, which is why got these. When the case is connected this way, press the button on its side, it lights up white and then it works like wired headphones.

Note that USB audio is only for audio output only (not microphone), and volume control works like wired headsets.

Bluetooth connection is multipoint and remembers the last 10 connected devices. Multipoint allows connecting a laptop or watch and phone simultaneously for example. Fast/Switch pair supported on Android and Windows also. It supports SBC, AAC and LC3 codecs.

The controls are very intuitive. It has physical buttons, with configurable actions for single, double of triple click on either earbud. Holding the buttons increases or decreases the volume.
It can launch the phone’s voice assistant (Siri on iPhones) and can optionally launch Spotify with clicks.
It also has ear detection so can pause music when taking one of the earbuds off.

Battery is rated to last 8 hours with ANC and 14 without, before the earbuds need to be recharged. The case can charge the earbuds 4 times before it needs to be recharged.

Overall these are excellent, and the addition of the 3.5mm/USB-C audio in the case makes them so more useful.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,0
Great for sweaty work outs and headphone jack use.,"Ear buds are just getting better and better...

Setup was really fast.  After initial charge of about 2 hours I went ahead and set this up on my 2 phones.  Both on android OS.  It took about 5 mins to do.  Great that these can pair with more than just 1 phone or device.  

The settings like noise cancelling and pass through was super easy to mess with and adjust in the software.  Button use.and voice commands was easy too.

Sound quality of music and phone were great.  I tested the Dolby Atmos spatial and it was decent...

In addition to 2 phone setup this can use the base as a transmitter to the ear buds....   this is great if you have an older headphone jack system with no Bluetooth like a CD player or hooking up to gym equipment etc....  Really versatile and convenient with these options to have this setup.

I have nothing but good sentiment about these ear buds.  Plus about 3 days worth of use with a fully charged holder and ear buds so far on a single charge.

Fit is great....  I worked out using these and even with full on swear.  They stayed out.  Did not fall out and did not get all clogged or drowned out the sound.

Nice color nice feel.  The feel has sort of a gripping type of surface..

I like these.  Been using these for over 1 week now.

Good job Jambra.

I would recommend these buds for the above.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,0
"Excellent sound quality, battery life, & durable!","When I heard I had the Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 coming my way, I was excited and saddened. Sad to hear that Jabra was leaving the consumer earbud space but excited because of what I had heard about the original Elite Active series! As soon as I opened the shipping box for these, I was impressed by how compact the packaging was. The last premium ANC earbuds I picked up were the Sony XM3s in 2019, five years of excellent audio quality and slowly reducing battery life ago, these are at LEAST half the size and weight! They feel premium, covered in a quality rubber that assures you it’s as tough as the box says it should be, the case is tiny compared to my old Sonys, so much more compact and convenient. Never fear, though, you can turn on “Find My Jabra” to trace your way back to where you might’ve left the case or earbud(s), I think this is just as thoughtful an inclusion as the tough build quality to ensure you can get your premium priced earbuds back if you lose them!

Setup is extremely easy, just download the app from scanning the QR code on top when you open the box and follow the instructions. This will suggest you follow a walkthrough of the features your new earbuds have and setup some of the behind-the-scenes items.

Features are plentiful! You can select what each number of taps does relating to a list of potential actions. The taps are of physical buttons on the earbuds, but they are soft enough to not put noticeable force into your ear like some require but also still works with gloves, sweat, and water on your fingers. In the app, you’re greeted with a handful of quick settings like selecting your listening mode (ANC, Hear Through, Off), EQ settings, and access to all of the other menus. You also can remove cards from the home screen, too.

Durability and battery life are amazing!!! The first day I got these, I took 5 minutes to quickly set them up to my Galaxy Z Flip 5, toss them in my ears, turn on hear through mode (with surrounds turned up to the max for safety), hopped on my bike and took off to my morning run club at the beach! This seemed like the perfect test of a “military grade” tough set of active earbuds… little bit of sand, lots of sweat, some water spillage, probable a drop, and maybe a quick swim. Well, I stopped after 5 minutes because the earbuds kept making a screeching noise and rebooting, I turned off the wind noise reduction mode and all was fine. It wasn’t quite working yet with the first batch of firmware, seems to be fixed now and Jabra customer support was friendly & helpful! They survived a sweaty 85F run, some beach volleyball, and I jumped in Lake Michigan for a quick swim. I know the Bluetooth isn’t going to stream through the water, but it feels great to jump in the lake immediately following a hot run or long bike ride and sometimes you just jump in without taking your gear off, earbuds included. They survived no problem and held a connection for longer than I thought! For battery, I only have to charge the case about once a week, maybe more if I bring them on a long distance bike ride, too, but if it’s runs, walks, in-office, listening at my desk, working at the bike stand, etc., once a week is more than enough to get you through! With the case using USB-C, you’ll have no problems finding a way to charge them if you need to and they can fast charge, too!

Overall, these things rock! The battery life is excellent, case is convenient and can double as a transmitter (hello Bluetooth on my old iPod!), the earbuds sound amazing with incredible noise cancellation, the hear through ambient mode is so clear that you might forget that you’re wear them, same with how lightweight they are! If you’re in the market for some of the best sounding and durable active earbuds, these are it. They’re expensive, but the features and quality are worth every dollar!",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,0
Best earbuds - They stay in you ear!!,"These are by far the best earbuds I have tried. A couple of key points for those that might be looking at earbuds, these stay in your ears firmly. I’ve used them for jogging and weightlifting with little to no movement. The sound quality is amazing as is the active noise cancellation. I can use them while riding in my jeep with the doors off and roof down and people on the other side have no idea because of their ability to block wind noise. I love being able to use the Smart Case to plug into the plane’s 3.5mm jack and use it for Bluetooth connectivity. I’ve since stopped using anything else for video calls as well. I bought a pair for my wife as well and will probably get a couple pairs as Christmas gifts.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,0
Great alternative to AirPod pros,"I was looking for a replacement for my iPod pros and after researching decided on these. I’ve been really pleased with them over the past few weeks. They are less noticeable than AirPods so I look normal on zoom calls, the actual button actions are nice, the noise cancelling is fantastic! I do struggle to get them connected every so often, but it’s infrequent so not terribly concerned with that. I also tried the cable they include that allows you to plug the case into a normal headphone jack while traveling and listen on the earbuds and it was seamless- very handy for work travel. Battery life is PHENOMENAL. They’re very functional and comfortable, I’m happy with my purchase.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,0

Well designed and engineered headset.,"These are phenomenal earbuds, but didn’t ultimately fit what I was looking for. 

Packed full of useful features for users of any type. The audio quality was excellent, fit was very comfortable for wireless earbuds. 

Pros: Waterproofed (note: I did not test these in a pool), active noise cancellation, hear-through capability to help you be aware of surroundings when needed, and a “pass through” mode to allow limited amount of outside sound through when you need it. 

The case can also be plugged in to other devices and used as a transmitter for the headphones for “older” devices with 3.5mm headphone jack. 

I ran into some issues with the app and activating some of the features, but that could be related to my device or something else. The app is very functional, well designed and guides you through setup and features/functions on the headset.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,1
A Reliable Choice for Active Lifestyles,"The Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 is a fantastic choice for anyone seeking high-quality, durable earbuds that cater to an active lifestyle. With a focus on delivering both premium sound and exceptional durability, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 performs remarkably well in most key areas.

Sound Quality

One of the standout features of these earbuds is their impressive sound profile. They deliver deep bass without overshadowing mids and highs, providing a balanced sound that’s perfect for music across genres, podcasts, and calls. Customization through the Jabra Sound+ app allows you to personalize the EQ, ensuring an ideal listening experience for any user.

Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode

The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 is effective at blocking out background noise, making them great for commuting or working out in noisy environments. The transparency mode (HearThrough) is also well-executed, allowing ambient sound in when needed without feeling too overwhelming or unnatural.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,1
Great for working out,"These are great earbuds for working out.  While they have never fallen out of my ears when I lean down (say negative sit-ups), they don't stay in as well as when standing up.  When inserted, I have to put it in the right earbud first, or it will not automatically turn on.  If I put in the left earbud first, the bud connects, but the left bud stays off.  The battery seems to last forever, I can work out 1.5 hrs a day all week with no charging.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A,0

Fantastic swan song for Jabra,"Most comfortable, best sounding no wire headphones I've ever owned, with one major caveat. These are so comfortable I forget that I have them in. No ear rubbing, no bulging on the sides of my ears. The largest size tips occupy my ear perfectly. The material does not slip out of my ear, whether in the gym or on a run, yoga/calisthenics, never had them slip.

The caveat is that your assistant cannot be turned on using the headphones while at the same time being able to control the volume using the headphones. You can, of course, use the assistant to control the volume but cannot use the buttons on the headphones while also having the buttons activate the assistant. 

Since I activate my assistant using voice commands but prefer to control volume physically, I've opted to disable the assistant being called using buttons to retain the volume control functionality. I did not dock a star as this has not diminished my enjoyment of the headphones, but I did waste 30 minutes or so trying to discover why I could not do both.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6582100&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1

Love these Jabras!,"These headphones are finally the ones that have everything I want in wireless headphones.  They fit so comfortably, it's easy to forget I have them on.  My last pair had wingtips for stability in my ear but they hurt my ear!  I read you would just have to get used to them but my ears never did.  I have tried similar style ear buds with touch control but found I like the Jabras better as they have a physical button.  Much better with the tactile feedback over the touch interface.  I haven't had the opportunity to try the smart case option yet, but that is another great option.  I like more bass in my music and was easily able to adjust the sound options in the Jabra app.  These were easy to pair with my android phone.

Good Bang For Your Buck,"Overall they’ve been a good addition to my earbud rotation. I’ve had em for about 1 month now and they’re definitely an upgrade to some of the other earbuds I had like Beats Studio buds + and beats fit pro. I particularly use these for talking on the phone while working and going about doing my daily activities and I’ve heard my voice sounds good, so no complaints there. The only gripe I have and it’s me nitpicking is the sound quality for music they’re not the best when it comes to bass and just having loud music on, but I guess I had gotten used to the beats sound. I definitely think they’re worth the price especially if you can get em on sale.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6582100&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1
Best Ear Buds I have used. THEY DO NOT MOVE!,"I was skeptical at first about these ear buds being able to stay in my ear. while I know Jabra makes top quality sound devices, I was not prepared for this experience.

Pros
These FIT like they are part of your ear. I have tried at least 20 different ear buds and none fit like these. I was not sure how they would work but from the first try in the parking lot (did not want to take them home if they did not fit like all the other) I knew these were golden. After a few days of use, these have not once moved from my ear. 
Comfort these are the most comfortable ear buds I have used. As in ear devices they are like they are not even there. Amazing
Sound What a rich and clear sound. With multiple default eq settings and the ability to customize it, the sound is amazing all around in these.
ANC. This is the best ANC I have used in a while. The world disappears when you turn it on. I mean, no sound gets through. Again, amazing

Cons
- There is no ambient sound mode with music. These have a passthrough setting, but the music stops when you activate it.

These are the best ear buds I have owned, and I have tried almost all brands (not beats, I am an Android user and they are mainly apple). I would tell everyone to get these.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6582100&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1

The microwave was good.  I just felt like another pair of earbuds that I kept actually sounded better.  These sounds good!  They aren't bad. If you aren't comparing to any other experience you'll definitely keep them and they probably sound better than most.  Because sound was the main criteria for me.

"Fine in quality, insane QOL decisions","These earbuds leave me conflicted; on one hand they’re very comfortable, durable, and the battery life is great. On the other, there are some design choices that confuse and frustrate me. Firstly, the left earbud can’t work independently, only the right can. Also, since the last set of Jabras I owned, they have REMOVED THE OPTION TO TURN OFF ANC OR HEARTHROUGH. The option is just gone, and the noise cancellation can’t keep up with any significant amount of wind blowing across the microphone (like one would encounter biking or running). So half of the time I can’t hear my music over the sound of the noise cancellation failing. This single issue stops these from being 5 star product all on its own for me, as I can’t use my fitness earbuds for either of my main exercises. Sad to say I dropped almost $250 on a product that feels worse to use than a previous (and less expensive) edition of the same brand.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-military-grade-wireless-in-ear-headphones-with-smart-case-black/6582100?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6582100&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1

Designed for all-day wear, these earbuds feature customizable silicone ear tips that provide a secure and comfortable fit, ensuring they stay in place during any activity.

One of the standout features of the AirPods Pro 2 is their active noise cancellation, which effectively blocks out external distractions, allowing you to immerse yourself fully in your music or podcasts. I have never experienced ear phones with that good of noise cancellation before icl. The addition of transparency mode is a game-changer, seamlessly blending your audio with your surroundings when you need to stay aware of what's happening around you.

Additionally, the charge on this seems to last forever which is a huge plus. I plug it in maybe every two days?

AirPods Pro,"Comfort: 8.5/10 - Very comfortable, doesn’t fall out even with aggressive head movement.

Touch Controls: 10/10 - The functions available for touch control (like volume slider) are useful. Using the touch functions is not hard to figure out. Unlike many other earbuds, you can adjust their angle in your ears without accidentally setting off a touch control.

Noise Cancelling: 10/10 - Works well overall. Amazing for almost completely blocking out consistent background noise, soft noises, and even some harsh noises (ex. tapping on a window).

Transparency Mode: 10/10 - Very good, sounds as though the headphones are not even in your ears.

Sound Quality: 9/10 - Good quality especially in such a small package.

Bass: 9.75/10 - The bass in these earbuds is great.

Battery Life: 8.5/10 - Good, the buds alone lasting a bit longer could be useful. The battery life information provided by Apple is accurate.

Overall, they work well and have many useful features. The earbuds seem to be a good discreet option for daily use.

Excellent for Apple Ecosystem,"I rate these as just a notch below my Sony XM over-the-ear headphones in terms of noise cancellation. They are quite effective in blocking out annoying distractions in noisy environments. My favorite feature is how they switch automatically between iPad, iPhone, and Mac, without having to touch Bluetooth settings. The “Find My” feature works quite well with these, better than the first generation AirPods Pros. They also seem to fit better and stay in place more reliably. About my only gripe is that the charge-state widget could be clearer about the charge condition of the individual buds when you are using one at a time as I often do, exchanging them into the charging case when they get low. 
The USB-C port is nice and has allowed us to ditch our lightning cables.",3,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382?variant=A,1

Pairing them with my devices was incredibly simple and fast, which makes switching between tasks a breeze.

What I love the most is how comfortable they are to wear for long periods. Whether I’m working, exercising, or taking calls, they stay secure and feel light. The battery life is impressive too—I can go all day without needing a recharge. The charging case is compact and convenient, perfect for on-the-go use.

My New AirPods!!,"After several months of enjoying the immersive sound and noise cancellation capabilities of my 1st generation AirPods Pro, I was disappointed to lose them. However, this mishap presented an opportunity to upgrade to the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). I made a choice that I never regret.

From the moment I unboxed the 2nd generation AirPods Pro, I noticed the familiar sleek design, promising an extension of the fashion-forward and technologically advanced experience I cherished with my first pair. But it wasn't until I put them to use that I realized just how incredible these earbuds are.

The sound quality has taken a noticeable leap forward. Thanks to the new Adaptive EQ, music feels more alive, enveloping me in layers of sound that I didn't realize were missing before. The bass is deeper, the highs are clearer, and every note feels tuned to perfection, adapting to my ear shape in real-time.

Noise cancellation, a feature I heavily relied on with the 1st generation, has been remarkably improved. The 2nd generation AirPods Pro create an even more serene audio sanctuary, allowing me to fully immerse myself in music or podcasts without the intrusion of external noise. This feature alone makes the upgrade worth it.

The addition of Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is a game-changer. Watching movies and listening to music is now an immersive experience that feels like I'm in the center of the action. The sound moves with me, creating a theater-like atmosphere that has to be experienced to be believed.

Battery life has also seen an improvement, providing up to 6 hours of continuous use with noise cancellation enabled. This is a significant upgrade from the 1st generation, ensuring I stay connected and entertained for longer. The charging case, now compatible with MagSafe and Apple Watch chargers, adds convenience to its functionality.

Perhaps one of the most practical features for someone like me, who has a history of losing earbuds, is the introduction of Precision Finding. The U1 chip in the charging case works with my iPhone to help locate it quickly, offering peace of mind and reducing the chances of another unfortunate loss.

In conclusion, upgrading to the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) has been an overwhelming experience in the best possible way. The improvements in sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life, and additional features like Spatial Audio and Precision Finding, make them a significant step up from the 1st generation. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a movie lover, or someone who appreciates the fusion of fashion and technology, the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) are a worthy investment that will elevate your audio experience to incredible new heights.",4,4,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6447382&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,0

Best purchase,"""I recently purchased the second-generation AirPods, and I've been impressed with their overall performance. The design is sleek and comfortable, fitting snugly in my ears without causing any discomfort, even during extended listening sessions.

Connectivity-wise, I've found them to be quite reliable, with minimal dropout issues, even in crowded areas. The seamless pairing process with my Apple devices is a definite plus.

Battery life has been sufficient for my needs, easily lasting a full day with intermittent use. The charging case is compact and convenient, and I appreciate the quick charging feature when I'm in a hurry.

In terms of sound quality, I find the AirPods 2 to be satisfactory for casual listening. While they may not rival high-end headphones in terms of audio fidelity, they deliver clear sound with decent bass response.

The hands-free Siri activation is a handy feature, allowing me to control my music and access other functions without reaching for my phone. I also appreciate the automatic ear detection, which pauses playback when I remove an AirPod.

Considering their performance and convenience, I believe the AirPods 2 offer good value for the price. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds.""",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6447382&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1

Sony's best earbuds to date,"I've enjoyed Sony's over-ear headphones for a while. I like their bass-heavy sound signature, it can be boomy while still clear. They have ANC that competes with other companies and is always in the top 5.

However, I've never liked their earbuds. The WF-1000XM3 never stayed in my ears and had terrible connectivity issues that made them completely unusable. The WF-1000XM4 stayed in my ears but hurt after a while and were too big. I stayed away from Sony and went through so many other companies. Each and every time I would conclude that ""these are my new earbuds!"" only to be disappointed a few weeks later with either ANC performance, fit, connectivity, bugs, or other issues that caused me to either exchange or return the earbuds.

I finally tried the WF-1000XM5, which I'm just going to call the XM5 from now on (Sony's naming scheme needs work). These are, without a doubt, the best true wireless earbuds I have listened to.

Sony cut down the size of the XM5 by quite a bit compared to the XM4 earbuds. Sony claims they're 25% smaller and I agree with that. There's no longer a large notch resting up against your outer ear and the rounded top fits within the pinna of the ear. These are so small, albeit still larger than the AirPods Pro 2, that I can comfortably sleep with them in.

Sony still relies on foam ear tips to achieve their sound and ANC. The ear tips are now a hybrid foam/rubber and more comfortable than the tips that came with the XM4. You don't need to squeeze the ear tips before inserting them in your ears. Just put them in and twist like normal earbuds. The XM5 still rely on the textured ear tips for staying in your ears, they aren't like the LinkBuds S where they use both the ear tips and earbuds to stay pinned in your ear. That's fine though, these haven't budged on me one bit after using them for multiple days for 6-8 hour each day.

Sony advertises 8 hours of battery life with ANC and the XM5 are able to reach that without issues. I've been able to hit the 8-hour mark and still have a 4-5% left in each earbud. The case provides 2 more charges allowing for 24 hours of use. A quick 2-minute charge will give you 1 hour of use.

ANC is top notch. I still they think fall behind the Bose QC Ultra earbuds and it's clear Sony is relying on the foam ear tips for more passive noise isolation to aid the ANC. But these are still great, better than the AirPods Pro 2, Jabra Elite 10, and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds. I can't much of anything when music or content is playing. Even sitting here now typing on a mechanical keyboard with music paused, the loud clicks of the keys are dull thuds. These have no issues on flights, blocking out the rumble of engines and HVAC systems, and various other sounds. Turn on music and the world is silenced.

Transparency mode is fine. It's not Bose or Apple-level, but it's still good enough. There's even a mode to amplify voices and block out other noises. One area Sony drastically improved is with microphones. Their processor effectively filters out background noise and isolates your voice for call. It might be more muted than the AirPods Pro 2, but they do a much better job of removing background noise. I've had no complaints taking phone calls next to busy roads, in the wind, and next to an external boiler for an HVAC system.

Controls are limited to simple touches that you can adjust. Single, double, triple, and quadruple taps along with a tap and hold can all do something. I left the default controls since it allows for volume control. Quadruple tap on the right earbud to increase volume, do the same on the left do decrease it. I much prefer having swipe controls for that, I have a feeling Sony will add those to the WF-1000XM6 next year.

The earbuds feature wear detection and will automatically pause and resume content when you remove one (or both) earbuds and put them back in. The case features for USB-C and Qi charging. Sony rates the earbuds as being IPX4 water-resistant. I haven't tested that outside of wearing these while profusely sweating from mowing the lawn. I'm not sure I would exercise with these, there are better earbuds for that with wing/fin tips. I also have a feeling that the foam ear tips would deteriorate after a while.

With all that said, how do they sound? Great. I didn't like the default sound profile. It's fine. Instead, I switched it to Excited in the app and bumped the Clear Bass up to +10 instead of +8. Yeah, some people would call that EQ an abomination, but I don't care. The bass is clear and boomy, mids still come across and aren't covered by the low, and the highs are details.

The sound stage is wide for earbuds. I think the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 are wider, but these are still good for closed-back earbuds. I don't have any complaints about the sound stage or instrument separation. Atmos music in Apple Music offers a nice listening experience. You don't get head tracking. I hate having to look straight forward for a balanced audio experience so I turned that off when I had the AirPods Pro 2 and Beats Fit Pro.

Overall, these are fantastic earbuds. I know some people are concerned with their battery longevity. The XM4 earbuds are known to be problematic. I haven't had any issues with these and I'm sure they'll be fine. Otherwise Sony's warranty will cover battery repairs by the time I'm ready to upgrade (the WF-1000XM6 are due about a year from now).

I highly recommend these if the XM3 and XM4 earbuds didn't fit your ears. They're smaller, sound quality is great, ANC is still top notch, and they're an overall improvement over older models. Connectivity has been great with no skipping or audible issues. You can't go wrong with these.",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A,1
Very convenient with some good flexibility in use!,"I have used the Bose QC ultra and enjoyed them but lost them and decided to give these a try. The sound quality feels more clear with vocals and the multi point is the best feature I didn't know I needed. 

I can watch YouTube on my Samsung phone and simply pause the video/music and start playing something on my iPad and it switches seamlessly.

I am fairly new to wireless earbuds as I have mostly only used Sennheiser and beyerdynamic. These are so convenient to carry around and they have been very comfortable to me. I worry about them falling out more than the Bose but they have been pretty snug.

The battery life is incredible. I have fallen asleep with these and have woken up 8 hours later with them still charged (Nothing playing with ANC on). this is a big advantage over the Bose. I feel like the ANC is not as good but it's really hard to tell. They are quite similar enough to me that it doesn't matter.

Just a note on the apps between the two. The Bose app almost always fails to connect and requires re-pairing the buds or at least 20+ tries to get the app working to change settings or EQ but the Sony app works flawless and is always ready to go to make adjustments or EQ.

The only issue I have had with these is the touch controls. I wish I could remap them to whatever I want but you can only set them between a couple of predefined profiles(Bose is the same if I am remembering right).

Overall I am really enjoying the Sony XM5 buds",3,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A,0
Good upgrade from the XM4s,"I had the WF-1000XM4s before the XM5s and I gotta say all the major flaws the XM4s had were solved with the XM5s. Notably, the smaller size of the buds make them more comfortable and reduce fatigue over a long period of time. I had major battery issues with the XM4s (that were apparently caused by a Sony software update, thanks Sony) but they seem to have overcome that issue. ANC has improved a bit but not much. Still love the sound from the Sony earphones over other brands I have tried, which is why I keep going back to them.

As for a flaw of the XM5s, the ambient noise mode has too much of an unnatural sound for me to use it comfortably. I'd rather just take the earbuds off to converse with somebody. Also the price, my wallet didn't appreciate that.

Side note, I bought a silicone case for them to prevent damage to the case as I've noticed they get scratched easily. Wireless charging works the same, highly recommend",5,2,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A,0
40 out of 50,"I rate earbuds on 5 things, Noise Canceling, Sound, Voice Calling, Controls & Ear Fit.
Many professional reviews on these expensive earbuds or over-ear headsets are never helpful and accurate.  
Noise Canceling: Bose noise canceling is great (10), better than close comparison Sony - WF1000XM5 (9). Sennheiser Momentum closely matches up well with Bose (10).
Sound: Bose Sound is great, gives you a good spatial audio with bass and just has good depth (9.5), The Sony - WF1000XM5 sound is seriously not great, very mundane in my view, good treble (8). Sennheiser Momentum sound doesn’t have as much base to the Bose, but overall sound is better than the Bose (10).
Voice Calling: Most of this are ok with voice calling. I would say the Bose is a 9, Sony - WF1000XM5 is a 7 and Sennheiser Momentum 8.5
Controls: Bose controls are easier 10, Sony - WF1000XM5 packaging doesn’t even show the controls, have to research it (8) and Sennheiser Momentum 10.
Ear Fit (working out, not running): Bose fits well and stays (10). Sony - WF1000XM5 with the different tips do not stay in ear well (8). Sennheiser Momentum fits and stays well (10)",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A,0
Amazing Fit and Sound. Better than LinkBuds S,"Disclaimer:
I want to preface this with a disclaimer: I have weird ears and am VERY picky on my earbuds. 90% of the earbuds I try DO NOT fit my ears. This includes previous Sony Earbuds, and other popular models like AirPods/AirPod Pros. I have bought and returned BOTH previous models of this earbud, the WF-1000MX3 & WF-1000MX4. But that all changed when these arrived! Finally, a pair of Sony WF Earbuds that I love! 

Fit & Sound:
The fit is amazing. I can wear these for hours without them bothering me. I love the earbud tips they come with, it’s an interesting hybrid of foam and rubber. But since they are kinda foam, you’ll want to make sure you are ‘rolling’ them on your fingers before insertion, as to smash the foam down. This allows them to expand in your ears for a proper fit. 
Also they sound amazing. The new bigger drivers are clearly at work here. ANC is a little better than the previous model I owned, LinkBuds S, but a little worse than the WH-1000MX5 (expected since those are full fat over-ear headphones. FIT IS ESSENTIAL HERE… POOR FIT = POOR ANC. Use all included ear tips and the Sony Headphones app which has a fit test. Some on Reddit also report good results with 3rd part EarTips but BE CAREFULL… these earbuds have no built-in mesh to stop your earwax from gumming them up, the mesh is on the EarTips… so make sure your 3rd part EarTips have mesh. Ambient sound mode is fine but has never blown me away. Can get a little windy which is annoying. I wish they would bring back the muffle wind option in the app.

Battery Life:
I have had great results on battery life so far. I think these could easily last a whole workday with ANC in their current state. But who knows how long that’ll last. Because of all the battery failures on the WF-1000MX4, I bought the Geek Squad protection just in-case.

Other Features:
Get the Sony Headphones app! They have a ton of cool features. I like the one where it tracks my weekly sound allowance and makes sure I’m not damaging my ears. You can also do stuff like spatial audio (doesn’t work on my new Samsung phone ugh) and enable stuff like nodding your head to accept/decline a call. Also you can manage sound quality settings, like using LDAC, and multipoint which allows you to connect to 2 devices at once (so awesome!). It also tracks the hours you put on the headphone if you sign into a Sony account, which I find very cool. Can’t wait to rack up 1000+ hours on these. 

VS LinkBuds S & Conclusion:
The LinkBuds S are another pair of Sony Earbuds that surprised me with how much I loved them. I think the MX5 sound better, due to their larger drivers. Also the ANC is a tad better on the MX5. Probably just mostly due to the better fit, but Sony would have you to think its all their new fancy chips in the MX5. I’m not sure. 
But here’s my conclusion: if you want 80% of the advantages of these earbuds and paying less than 80% of the price, I’d get the LinkBuds S on a sale for $120. But if you just want the best there is, get these. They fit and sound slightly better, with slightly better battery life. Get the Headphones app and keep and eye on the battery! May be worth it to get Geek Squad as well.",5,2,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A,1
"The WF1000-xm5, Sony Sound Cancelling Earbuds","These have the best sound quality I have ever heard out of a pair of earbuds. The sound cancelling is amazing, the battery life is outstanding, and they don't falling out when you use the right earbud tip. They come with 4 and if I remember right medium is already on there and it goes all the way down to super small, and I was using those until I tried to clean them, the tips get very dirty as they are made out the same type of foam the ear plugs are made of, the will pull most of the earwax out of your ear. So cleaning them is a must, this however is very hard to do they are extremely easy to damage with finger nails, they fall apart in hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol, use warm water and a cotton q-tip. There are some cheap replacement options on amazon. 
Now on to the sound quality and range, The biggest thing is the sound cancelling on these is out of the world because of the tips are designed to seal your ear completely so it is insane good, The highs are amazing and mediums are amazing, and the lows are great. The lows are diffidently the spot they lack in. The sony headphone app will help a lot with that so I highly recommend using it. The battery life is probably like 8 hours per charge, I could spend a whole day using them and they would not disconnect or anything. Pairing them to a pc is easy as long as pc or laptop has bluetooth just open the case and hit the pair button the back. I use them a lot when I drive to answer calls or just to listen to music. The call quality is lacking and makes it go to transparency mode automatically.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A,0

The battery life also seems to be much improved.

I’ve tried troubleshooting it and restarting and even asking it politely to work, soo. that’s a thing that may happen beware. Also, I wish it came with smaller earbud tips because of my stupid tiny ear canals so I had to switch em out.

Sound Issues at 299.99,"First off the design of the earbuds are amazing.  The fit and feel way better than the ""Sony WF-1000XM4.""

Sony also having their own app to help you customize your headphones/earbuds is quite a nice feature.

Secondly an improvement from it's predecessor is that you can use either earbud how you want.  With the ""WF-1000XM4"" the right earbud was the ""main"" so if you wanted to use the left, you had to have both.  The Sony Wireless WF-1000XM5 allows you to use whichever you please which is preferable.

The only issue I have is sound quality.  Sony has come a long way, so should their products.  Sometimes it sounds amazing, sometomes I to turn it all the way up just to hear it.  The most frustrating issue is their are time's where it sounds like certain parts of the track is muffled or underwater.  Some might try to say that ""oh your listening to a posted version from an unreliable source"" but I listen to it directly from the artist themselves.

Overall the earbuds aren't bad, Sony is heading in the right direction.  Just some small tune ups.",1,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A,1
Great switch from AirPods.,"Talk about about a learning curve moving from AirPods to Sony but I'm kinda glad they did.

"Best-in-class, but improvements are possible","Last week, I traded in my old pair of WF1000XM4's for these, and much like the previous model, they are excellent noise cancelling earbuds with long battery life, and great portability. In the interest of full disclosure, I use non-standard memory foam eartips from Comply, which in my particular case improve comfort and noise isolation. Sound quality is crisp and clear, the touch controls are relatively intuitive, the earbuds themselves feel relatively light, and can sit comfortable in my ears for hours at a time. The multiple-device connection feature works pretty seamlessly too, and it's very convenient for any situation that may require you to switch back and forth between two audio sources. For anyone looking for a set of ultra-portable noise cancelling headphones, I can highly recommend these.

Despite my general satisfaction, I do have a few minor gripes about this new model. The glossy plastic finish on the earbuds looks excellent, but it makes them feel a little slippery. I can't help but think it's going to lead to them getting dropped a few times. I've also run into a few bugs when using these earbuds to control Audible playback, especially when connecting to multiple devices at once. I'm hesitant to blame Sony for that, as I've definitely found Audible to be one of the most temperamental apps I use regularly when it comes to playback control, regardless of the device controlling it. Finally, while these do feel more comfortable than the outgoing model, I find it a little harder to get them in and out of my ears than the previous model due to the rounded design and glossy plastic surface. Adjusting how I hold them has helped, but it just doesn't feel as natural as it did with my old pair. Perhaps that's habit more than anything, as I had that pair for almost 3 years. All of these are minor issues, none of which would lead me to choose a different product over these, but I felt compelled to mention them nevertheless.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A,1
The pickup is remarkable.,"The requirement for new earbuds arose due to the unfortunate misplacement of my Galaxy Buds 2 Pro by my children.

Glad I kept my WF1000XM4s,"Any enthusiasm I had for these is pretty much gone, and very happy I didn’t sell off my WF1000XM4s.  
They sound excellent, they pair up right well with the iPhone; beyond that, the little annoyances start to add up.  
First, the fit.  If you have larger ears, you’re going to experience a lot more outside noise than usual.  Some odd reason, the fit isn’t as tight as the previous model.  Switching to a larger tip makes it uncomfortable for me and then you have this issue where it doesn’t fit in the case perfectly.  Hopefully a third party like Comply or SpinFit will update their catalog to maybe remedy this. 
Two, random dropouts during playback.  Sometimes it’ll be the right bud, or both.  This may or may not be linked to the “unknown accessory” tab that randomly pops up on my phone screen.  This has never happened on the previous model or any of my other wireless ANC buds.  It’s quite annoying.  
New tips, maybe a firmware update will correct these annoyances ?

Endgame earbuds,"A fantastic pair of earbuds that have blown every other pair I've tried out of the water. From the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro to the Technics AZ80, these buds outshine everything in terms of both sound quality and features. Sifting through the app (which sets up quick and easy) allows for one to toggle between ANC modes, set the modes to automatic, enable a Spotify quick play gesture directly on the earbuds, switch bluetooth codecs, toggle DSEE Extreme (lossy music upscaler), and calibrate head tracking amongst other things. The standout feature for a bass head like myself is Sony's Clear Bass technology, which allows for a crisp boost to the bass without a loss of volume or fidelity across the higher frequencies.

First off, I have huge comfort issues with the included foam eartips. They really start to hurt after about an hour or so. Second, the nozzle of the buds doesn't have any form of mesh or protection to stop earwax and moisture from entering the buds. This makes it increasingly difficult to buy silicone tips and when I did, the fit and ANC suffered greatly. Third, the ambient mode is average at best. Fourth, I absolutely HATE that I can't customize what the touch controls do. I've also never really been a fan of Sony's app. But overall, these are a great set of earbuds and I do recommend them",5,1,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6546812&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1
A worthy successor to the WF-1000XM4s,"If you’re looking for the best in sound quality from true wireless earbuds, you’ve come to the right product.

Great product,"Maybe one of the best headphones in the ear I’ve ever had. The only downside is that they do fall out sometimes not sure if it’s just my ear, but that is the only problem I have with them other than that I love how they track how long you listen when you listen the times and the dates and I really love how it tracks a lot of your stuff And they’re headphones highly recommend",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6546812&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1
Good but not great!,"these are pretty good, but i ended up returning them and i will explain why:
I got both these and the Bose - QuietComfort Ultra, and as a BB total member, had some time to make the decision between the two. Went on 4 flights and compared overall performance between the two options, and the Sony fell a bit short on some key features for me:

1. Active Noise Cancellation: The Bose are way better in the ANC feature, especially in a flight, but even overall in a noisy environment, with high volume conversations in the background, The Sony were good, but in my opinion not even remotely close to the Bose.
2. Comfort in the ear: the Sony hve this foam like material that expands in the ear, which on the positive adds some more blocked noise cancellation, but on the negative after a while you start feeling in in your ear.
3. Sound wuality: I think the Bose are a better sound overall, both on phone calls and on music. Watched several TV shows and a Movie with both, and the sound coming from the Bose was more crisp and rich but the sound from the Sony was more bass and deep, so i guess it's a matter of individual preference.
4. App: having both apps, i can definitely say they both suck, but the Bose app sucks a bit less. I had some connectivity issues with the Sony on both my Samsung S24 Ultra and my Lenovo Laptop - maybe it was a local problem with the pair i had, but the BT kept disconnecting from the earbuds perspective once every couple of hours.

The only definitive advantage i found with the Sony earbuds was the microphone. the mic on the Sony is way better when having a phone call when compared to the Bose. the Bose have this echo resonance in the background but the Sony sounds good and clean. Verified with several calls to people and getting their feedback on how they heard the conversation from their perspective.

Overall, these are great, but for my individual needs the Bose were just a bit better (higher need for flights ANC).",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-wf1000xm5-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6546812?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6546812&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,0

Very good,"I’m a bit of an audiophile, so searching for the perfect earbuds was difficult. There are lots of options for higher-end earbuds. After watching and reading many reviews, I decided to get these. I had a pair of WF1000-XM3 for a few years and I had no complaints. I’m very happy with these WF1000-XM5 earbuds. The memory foam tips are really nice, and seal to your ear nicely without being uncomfortable. The earbuds are not bulky. The sound quality is nearly perfect for wireless earbuds.

I only wore one earbud throughout the duration of the car ride and couldn’t hear my surroundings. I am really happy with my purchase as I also have the WH-1000XM4 headphones and I use them as my gaming headphones.

Unparalleled Audio Experience with Beats Stuido Bu,"Title: Unparalleled Audio Experience with Beats Studio Buds!

Review:

I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds in the striking Beats Red color, and I am absolutely thrilled with my decision! These earbuds have not only met but exceeded my expectations in every possible way, offering an audio experience that's truly in a class of its own.

Firstly, the design of the Beats Studio Buds is sleek and modern, with the Beats Red color adding a vibrant touch that stands out. They are incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods, and the secure fit ensures they stay in place during workouts or on the go.

The noise cancelling feature of these earbuds is a game-changer. It effectively blocks out external noise, allowing me to immerse myself in the music or focus on my calls without any distractions. Whether I'm commuting, in a noisy environment, or just enjoying my favorite tunes at home, the noise cancellation creates a personal oasis of sound.

Sound quality is where the Beats Studio Buds truly shine. The audio is crisp, clear, and balanced, with a depth that brings every song to life. The bass is punchy without being overpowering, and the highs are bright and distinct. Whether I'm listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the sound is consistently impressive across all genres.

The wireless connectivity is flawless, with quick and easy pairing to my devices. The touch controls are intuitive, allowing me to manage playback, answer calls, or activate voice assistance with simple gestures. The battery life is also commendable, providing hours of uninterrupted listening pleasure.

In conclusion, the Beats Studio Buds are a fantastic investment for anyone seeking superior sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design. They have become an indispensable part of my daily routine, enhancing every moment with their exceptional audio performance. If you're in the market for wireless earbuds that deliver on all fronts, look no further than the Beats Studio Buds in Red",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A,1

"Long, but worth the read!","Pros: •Sound Quality: best sound I’ve had from headphones in a while. I also appreciate the ability to switch between noise cancellation & transparency mode.  •Size: small enough to fit in most pockets but big enough to remind me I have them in my pocket. •Design: the unique shape fits perfectly in my hands. I also appreciate the variety of colors that are available (I chose red since my iPhone is the same color).
Cons: •The Buds: I’m not sure if it’s a defect or just my ears, but I had a difficult time getting them to stay in my ears, even after switching to the smallest size. •Design: It fits perfectly in my hands, but it is super smooth, making it easy to drop. I’d recommend finding a case, which has proven to be difficult for me. •Doesn’t come with an adapter, just the cord, which is very short (I’ve already lost it).
Overall: I’d still recommend buying. I love them.",5,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A,1
Great… but not amazing,"PROS: Honestly great pair of earbuds. You can go pretty far away from them and they don’t lose connection. You’d think the walls of your home would be a problem, not for these earbuds! Noise canceling is wonderful. So Is the microphone. it’s really good at catching just your voice among all the cluttering noise around you. 
          Connectivity: Be advised BEATS are an Apple owned product and therefore work very well amongst the Apple ecosystem Especially when connecting and disconnecting. 
           Battery Life: these earbuds are insanely good at keeping a charge. A 5 min charge gives you and hour of playback time.
CONS: The only reason I'm giving a 4 is just because recently inside one of my earbuds something came lose and now rattles whenever I listen to music. To be fair I like listening to music loudly, and I think that causes some of the problem.",28,7,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A,1
Good sound quality but awful fit,"Sound quality is great as well as battery life, iPhone connectivity is designed the same way as AirPods, my only issue is the constantly fall of my ears when working out (reason I got them) I even tried the 3 different earbuds sizes they come with but same results. I’ll be returning them.",7,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A,0
A great alternative to AirPod Pros,"I used to have Airpods Gen 2 and currently had AirPod Pros. My Pros started to crackle and since they were out of warranty Apple was charging me to replace the faulty one. Anyways, venturing to look for headphones that were wireless, had active noise cancellation, and played well with the Apple ecosystem was kind of slim pickings. Thankfully these Beats Studio Buds fit my lifestyle perfectly. 

What works? They’re nicely designed albeit kind of odd looking. But once they’re in the ear they’re really comfortable. Sound quality isn’t as good as my Pros but they’re still not shabby - they’re loud and bass-y. The “b” as a button control is pretty dope and it has become second nature after having these for a few days. Then the connectivity, brilliant. They connect just the same as AirPods do - open them up near an Apple device and it’ll connect. Oh, and it’s in the “Find My” app. Active noise cancellation works quite well too, though I haven’t really tried out transparency mode since I don’t like it in general. Finally, they do stay in the ear quite well. I’ve only gone on walks with these but I’m sure they’ll fit quite snug while I’m on a run. 

What doesn’t work? At this price point, it kind of makes sense, but it’s lacking the feature where when you take it out of your ear it pauses. It’s a small gripe, and something I do miss, but it’s not a dealbreaker. Then the case… it’s poorly made and plastic feeling. It’s also really slippery. If one day I drop these and they go down the sewers, well, I wouldn’t be all that surprised. It’s too bad that there’s no wireless charging either. But I guess it’s fine at this price point.

All in all, this will hold me over quite well I imagine while I wait for the AirPod Pros 2. I would recommend these in a heartbeat.",18,4,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A,1

Definitely great budget set though would honestly wouldn't pay more than $100 and now I still own it and use it casually as my second pair.

airpods & studio buds,"So if you are one of those people who were on the fence with these headphones. Allow me to help. So I have all the earbuds and headphones known to man for some reason, but regardless i will say yes these are NOT better than the Airpod Pros, the pros have a little more bass to it, user friendly wigs to it, like how the music will stop if one ear bud isn’t in and etc and overall offer more “bells and whistle” for lack of better term right now….. however though these are pretty nice. Like, really nice. The quality, the clarity in the songs are legit. It is worth the buy, as the main reason for me was i liked how they came in different colors as i prefer the sleek, stealth design the black ones give. But yes they are like a  step below the pros, but for sure worth a try. It took “Avalanche” by Migos and then switched it up to “Waves of Blue” by Majid Jordan to tell me that these are amazing.

OUTSTANDING!!!!,"I really love the feel and look of these, I definitely prefer the beats over Apple pros. Definitely love that they came in white so I can match my Apple devices! The price is outstanding for the quality and I was surprised to see they finally came out with what I’ve been wanting, no cords, no wrap around the ear, no attaching one to the other to wrap around the back of your neck. The sound for the phone is crisp and clear, no echo and the listener doesn’t hear most of the background noise; so noise canceling quality is great! Very pleased! The only thing is I expected the music quality to be just a little bit better for these being beats. It’s great tho. Not enough difference to make a fuss over. Also the USB C charger is a nice thing, but doesn’t come with a wall plug, you’ll need something to plug in each end for charging. Both ends is USB-C.

I would recommend these to anyone looking for good sound quality with earbuds.

Fit: I noticed myself that I use a larger fit in my right ear and then the original size (Medium fit) in my left. If they don’t fit your ears switch out the silicone sizes and see what fits for you.


Few things that hold these back right now :

1. When answering calls and using facetime the audio does not switch automatically to your studio buds , you will have to do that part manually. With the Air pods you don’t have that issue.

2. If your adjusting your Studio buds while in your ear you could accidentally hang up/end a call by pressing the (b) beats button. I’ve done it a few times myself and it takes a little practice to adjust them without hanging up on someone.


3. (Opinion) Quality could be a bit better with the Studio buds case . Feels a bit cheap for the Beats brand and i’ve dropped the case on tile and the both buds will fly out occasionally haha. I dropped them (accidentally, again ) in a parking lot but this time the buds did not fly away.",6,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A,1

Great 2nd Pair of TWS Earbuds,"First off I am surprised at this new release from Beats (Apple). I wasn't expecting the sound to be as it is. Usually the boomy bass and muddy mids is what you get from Beats, except this time it has been improved and it resembles a more refined sound with enough bass and better audio presentation. The design of Earbuds is not new to me as I feel Beats (Apple) borrowed the design of the Earin A-3 but with eartips added. Still this is a more comfortable and secure fit than my AirPods Pro. My Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are my most comfortable and extended listening pair and the ones I tend to pick up more. The AirPods Pro are 2nd to none in the clarity and call department. We can't get Audiophile Sound from TWS just yet although technology has improved tremendously but until then these are some of the few earbuds I use for TWS earphones. I have some EarFun Free Pro's, just pre-ordered the Life P3's as well but for now... These Beats Earbuds will suffice and I would definitely recommend to anyone beit iOS or Android user!",2,2,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/4900915?variant=A,1
A BEAST of headphones!?,"Hey everyone, it's me... AGAIN!, I’m here to share my thoughts on the Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones that I snagged from Best Buy. These aren’t just any headphones; these are the kind that promise to drown out the world around you with some fancy noise-cancelling tech.

**PURCHASE DETAILS**
I got lucky and caught these on a sale. I’m talking a sweet deal that didn’t make my wallet cry. Plus, being part of the Best Buy Total Tech gang has its perks - these cans came with AppleCare+ at no extra charge. Haven’t needed it for these headphones yet, but when I had a clumsy moment with my iPhone, AppleCare+ was a lifesaver, so it’s nice to have that safety net.

**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**
Out of the box, these headphones had that ‘new tech’ vibe that gets you all excited. They’re sleek, got that premium feel, and the Sandstone color is just classy. Picking them up, they felt solid but not like they’d be a weightlifting session for my neck. And those cushioned ear cups? They looked like they were going to be a treat for my ears. I couldn’t wait to put them to the test and see if they lived up to the hype.

**SETUP AND EASE OF USE**
Setting these up was a breeze. It was pretty much a case of 'turn on Bluetooth', 'select headphones', and bam! We were connected. No fiddling around, no 'why won’t you pair?!' moments. They synced up with my phone faster than I can make a cup of coffee. And switching from my phone to my laptop? Seamless. The controls are intuitive too; a few taps on the ear cup and I’m in control of my music, no need to fish out my phone.

**DESIGN AND COMFORT**
The design? It’s like they were made for my head. They’ve got this cool, understated look that doesn’t scream 'I’m trying too hard.' And comfort wise, it’s like snuggling your ears into your favorite pillow. I've worn them for hours, and there’s been no ear squishing or head clamping. They stay put, too, even when I’m headbanging to my favorite jams or shaking my head at another pointless meeting.

**PERFORMANCE**
Now, let’s talk about what you’re really here for – the noise cancellation and sound. The noise cancellation is the real deal. It’s like having your own personal mute button for the world. I’m talking ‘can’t hear the construction outside’ levels of quiet. And the sound? Crisp highs, balanced mids, and bass that’s just deep enough to feel in your chest without overpowering everything else. Battery life is solid too. I’ve gone days without a charge, and they’re still pumping out tunes like there’s no tomorrow.

**APPLECARE+ EXPERIENCE**
I haven’t had to use AppleCare+ for these headphones yet, which is a good thing, right? But knowing it's there is like having a safety net when you're walking a tightrope. I've had my dance with disaster before when my iPhone took a dive. AppleCare+ was a hero; got it fixed up without a fuss. It’s peace of mind, and with how I sometimes throw my stuff around, it’s not if I’ll need it, it’s when.

**PROS AND CONS**
Alright, so let's break it down. On the plus side, the sound quality is top-notch, and the noise cancellation is like a cone of silence; just magic. They're comfy enough to forget you're wearing them, and the battery life? It just goes on and on. But it's not all sunshine; the price tag can be a bit much if you don’t catch a sale like I did. And while the design is classy, it’s not exactly standout if you’re into that kind of thing.

**CONCLUSION**
Wrapping this up, I’d say these Beats Studio Pro headphones are a solid buy. They do what they say on the tin and then some. Whether you’re trying to focus in a noisy spot or just enjoy your tunes as the artist intended, these headphones have got you covered. They’re not just about the brand; they deliver.

**RATING**
I’d give them a strong 4.5 out of 5. Why not a full 5? Because perfect is a big word, and let's face it, the price can make you wince if you don’t snag that deal. But overall, these are some serious ear candy. Would recommend? Absolutely.",12,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A,1
They stay on & the sound is amazing blocks noise,"Perfect for the gym & for editing videos. I love the color so much they make every gym fit look cute! They block all outside noise, they don’t hurt my ears & they stay on while I workout. I do clean with a disinfectant wipe to clean sweat & bacteria off of them & they are perfect. Battery life is amazing & I am able to change music by calling Siri, might I mention I don’t have to be super loud at all for it to work & it’s hands free which is perfect for when I need to change the song in the middle of my set.

Great All around Headphones,"I love these headphones! It was either between the AirPod max or these and since they were on sale for a decent price, I decided to go with the Beats Studio pros in the color deep brown. The headphones are comfortable, the charge lasts a long time, and I’m able to use the same charger for my iPad Pro to charge these beats. It’s a win win. However, I feel like the sound on these headphones should be louder than what they are. I practically have to turn the volume to to almost 100% just so that I’m able to actually hear the bass in the songs I listen to. I know that Apple/Beats did this to protect people from harming their ears from loud sounds, but I don’t like the fact that I’m unable to change the volume from sounding too low even such a high volume. I’ve tried personalizing my Spatial Audio and it’s still sounds too low at 50% volume. In order for it to sound loud enough I have to keep the volume at around at least 90% volume. But other than that, they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and to do a decent workout in for long periods of time. They also sound excellent when I take phone calls. And I love how you can change the volume up and volume down, pause the music, and hang up phone calls without adding all those extra buttons to the headphones. Very minimalistic, sleek, and comfortable.",0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A,1
These are some exceptionally good headphones,"These headphones offer a commendable experience overall. The noise canceling effectively blocks out most surrounding noise, though the transparency mode is not quite on par with the AirPods Pro. However, the head tracking feature enhances the realism when combined with transparency mode.

The sound quality is decent, though not as premium as my Beats Studio 3. The bass is less pronounced, but the soundstage with Dolby Atmos is significantly wider, providing a more immersive listening experience.

The build quality leaves something to be desired. Folding and unfolding them feels a bit plastic and cheap, although the ear cuffs are an improvement over the Studio 3's. Despite this, they remain comfortable for extended use.

Overall, these are great headphones, and if you can get them at a discount, they are worth recommending.",2,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A,1
The Best Beats Ever,"Beats get better with every single release. These headphones are absolutely perfect for people who love music. When I put them on it’s like I am at a concert in the front row. The surround sound audio makes it feel like you’re inside of a studio. The noise cancellation is an amazing feature as well it makes me feel like i’m in my own world just me and my music. The audio quality gives the music so much more life. The transparency feature is also just as good, it works well when playing music as you can still hear your surroundings and your music with a perfect balance. the battery life is amazing as I have listened with them hours on end without fear of them dying. Whenever you want to escape from the outside world or just relax these Beats will do that for you to absolute perfection. These are the best headphones I have ever purchased and I use them everyday, mostly when studying and in the gym they provide me with 100% focus on my task with 0 distractions.

My review on the Beats Studio Pro,"I got these beats around my birthday, and that was about a month ago. So I have been using them for quite some time, and they have been amazing headphones. Honestly the best headphones I have had, they go over the ear, they have noise canceling and also transparency mode as well as the normal mode. They last a very long time I have only charged them about 4 times max since I have gotten them. It also doesn’t take a long time to charge. The sound is amazing, it is so smooth doesn’t have any cracks or anything. You can also use them wired if you don’t can’t charge them, it comes with the wire adapter as well as the charger in the carrying case that fits the beats so well. They are so nicely packaged, and very easy to open and very quickly. I got the beats in the color deep brown. I instantly loved the color when I saw it. I knew that was the color I was gonna get, but when I seen the other colors I was getting indecisive because they have very nice colors for the beats it might not be many colors, but the colors they give us makes up for it. The colors they gave us are black, deep brown, navy, and sandstone. They are a neutral colors and they looks amazing. The beats themselves looks so beautiful and the colors just make them even better. They are perfect for exercising, cooking, watching a show, anything you can possibly think of, so if you are thinking about buying Beats Studio Pros I’d say go for it and don’t wait.",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A,1

Perfection,"Sound is amazing. Noise cancellation is impeccable. I use them for the gym and they work incredible. I always wipe them down after though with the cleaning solution and paper towels they have there and they still look brand new even though I’ve seeat all over them and had them for 2 mos and go to the gym 4x a week. Before i bought them i read a bunch of reviews saying you shouldnt use over ear headphones for the gym because they start to break down and peel on the earpieces because of the sweat. If you clean them and take care of them, they work amazing for the gym so it’s pretty simple, just dont be a moron. I will say the only “drawback” if it’s even a drawback is that the Sandstone color online looks pretty much white/cream but its actually grey/beige or like greige in real life. Not a fan of the color selection but otherwise incredible headphones. I got a steal on mine at $179 and do NOT regret the purchase. My airpods constantly fell out at the gym so these are a godsend. And they stay charged FOREVER.

Great pair of headphones,These headphones look great in the sandstone color and on top of that they sound MUCH better than my AirPod pros. I get a much better listening experience with these. My only problem with these would be that they aren’t the most comfortable option out there since they are pretty tight and they tend to get uncomfortable after about an hour but I think for 180$ there is NO other pair of headphones that compete with these. If you’re thinking about purchasing a pair go ahead and buy them already they are a bang for your $.,1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A,1
Goldie locks found her sound :),"I really like these; this is my first set of headphone (since I was a teenager). I use my apple 2 pro earbuds a lot and love them but sometimes my ear gets a little irritated after all day and also no one can see then in my ears at work (girl long hair) so people have conversations with the back of my head :-/ These are much better on my ears and everyone can see them so they know to get my attention and that I’m not ignoring them. Besides these personal reasons I shipped online read many reviews and spoke to 2 BestBuy employees & cot lots of intel first. Budget wasn’t an issue I wanted something that sounded good, was comfortable, and had a long battery life. The apple ones were crazy heavy, the Sonys didn’t feel like the best fit or seem to noise cancel as good. These fit great, noise cancel really well, have a long battery, and sound crystal clear.

Don’t get me wrong those are extraordinary headphones too but, if you can save money and still have the sane premium features with more playback time. The Beats Studio Pro are the better buy!",1,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6501025&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,1
Another pair to my Studio Pro collection,The only thing that I noticed was different was  the over-ear cushions part is running smaller than previous versions of the Studio pro I’ve purchased.  The color of choice is Deep Brown which I fell in love. Sound quality is still amazing as always. Overall good pair of headphones especially if you hit the Gym.,0,0,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/beats-studio-pro-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black-gold/6501025?variant=A&pageSize=20&sku=6501025&sort=BEST_REVIEW&variant=A&page=2,0
